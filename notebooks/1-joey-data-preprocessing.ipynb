Mr. Gore was elected at Apple\\'s board meeting yesterday. Apple has commenced a formal search for a second independent director, which the Company hopes to add before the end of the summer. With the addition of the second independent director, five out of seven Apple directors will be independent under SEC and NASDAQ rules.\\n \\nApple\\'s Board of Directors has expanded the role of its independent Nominating Committee to include corporate governance as the new Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and has expanded the role of its Audit Committee in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and proposed SEC and NASDAQ regulations. These two committees are chaired by independent directors and staffed by a majority of independent directors.\\n \\nApple\\'s Board of Directors also approved two measures to reduce the Company\\'s issued stock options as a percentage of total options and shares outstanding from the current level of 23 percent to 16 percent. The first measure is a voluntary employee stock option exchange program which allows the Company\\'s employees who are not executive officers and hold options with\\nexercise prices at or above $25.00 to exchange them for a lesser number of new stock options priced at fair market value six months and one day after their existing options are cancelled. The second measure is for Apple CEO Steve Jobs to voluntarily exchange his 27.5 million stock options for a new grant of 5 million restricted shares that will vest on the third anniversary of the grant. Together these measures are expected to return a net total of over 32 million options back to the Company, which represent almost 7 percent of the total options and shares currently outstanding.\\n \\nIn addition, the Board approved cancelling the Company\\'s non-shareholder approved option plan upon the completion of the employee exchange program and shareholder approval to amend the remaining shareholder-approved executive officer stock plan so it can be used to grant options to all employees.\\n \\n\"This is a good day for Apple\\'s shareholdersthey will have even more independent representation on their Board, the addition of a terrific new director in former Vice President Al Gore and a reduction in issued stock option overhang from 23 percent to 16 percent,\" said Steve Jobs, Apple\\'s CEO. \"Apple makes the best personal computers in the world and there is no reason why it shouldn\\'t be among those companies with the best corporate governance in the world.\"\\n \\nMore information on Apple\\'s corporate governance standards can be found at www.apple.com/investor. Terms and conditions of the Employee Stock Option Exchange program are contained in a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO that Apple filed with the SEC today.\\n \\nApple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement\\n \\nApple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan\\nOn April 21, 2005, the shareholders of Apple Computer, Inc. approved the Apple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan (the \"Bonus Plan\"). The Bonus Plan is intended to permit the payment of bonuses that qualify as \"performance-based compensation\" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\\nDescription of the Performance Bonus Plan\\nELIGIBILITY. Participants in the Bonus Plan are executive officers and key employees who are chosen solely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and all executive officers are eligible to be considered for participation in the Bonus Plan. As of December 10, 2004, all executive officers, excluding the CEO, were chosen to participate for fiscal year 2005. No person is automatically entitled to participate in the Bonus Plan in any Bonus Plan year. The Company may also pay discretionary bonuses, or other types of compensation, outside of the Bonus Plan.\\nPURPOSE. The purpose of the Bonus Plan is to motivate the participants to achieve certain corporate and business unit performance objectives and to reward them when those objectives are satisfied. If certain requirements are satisfied, bonuses issued under the Plan may qualify as deductible \"performance-based compensation\" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m).\\nADMINISTRATION. The Bonus Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of no fewer than two members of the Board. With respect to incentive compensation that is intended to qualify as \"performance-based compensation\" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m), each member of the Compensation Committee who does not qualify as an \"outside director\" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code will recuse himself or abstain from acting with respect to Bonus Plan determinations and at least two members of the Compensation Committee who do qualify as \"outside directors\" shall make Bonus Plan determinat ions. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee, William V. Campbell, does not qualify as an \"outside director\" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) because he once served as an officer of FileMaker, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company. Accordingly, Mr. Campbell will recuse himself or abstain from acting with respect to Bonus Plan determinations.\\nDETERMINATION OF AWARDS. Under the Bonus Plan, participants will be eligible to receive awards based upon the attainment and certification of certain performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee. The performance criteria the Compensation Committee may choose from may include one or more of the following: annual revenue, cash position, earnings per share, net income, operating cash flow, operating income, return on assets, return on equity, return on sales, total shareholder return, and individual performance objectives.\\nThe performance criteria may differ for each participant. Performance criteria may apply to the Company or to one of the business units. Any individual performance objectives must relate to an objective that is objectively determinable within the meaning of Code Section 162(m). For example, individual performance objectives may include objectively measurable improvement in the Company\\'s customer satisfaction.\\nThe Compensation Committee shall appropriately adjust any evaluation of performance under a performance criterion to exclude (i) any extraordinary non-recurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management\\'s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations appearing in the Company\\'s annual report on Form 10-K to shareholders for the applicable year, or (ii) the effect of any changes in accounting principles affecting the Company\\'s or a business unit\\'s reported results. The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate any award that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the Bonus Plan.\\nOn December 10, 2004, within 90 days after t he start of the Company\\'s 2005 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee established target awards for each executive officer, excluding the CEO, based on revenue and operating margin goals. These 2005 fiscal year bonuses are intended to qualify as deductible \"performance-based\" compensation under Code Section 162(m).\\nPAYMENT OF AWARDS. All awards will be paid in cash as soon as is practicable following determination of the award, unless the Company establishes a plan to permit deferral of bonus amounts, in which case awards will be paid pursuant to the timing requirements of that plan and applicable law. The Committee may also defer the payment of awards in its discretion, as necessary or desirable to preserve the deductibility of such awards under Code Section 162(m).\\nMAXIMUM AWARD. The maximum bonus payment that any participant may receive under the Bonus Plan in any fiscal year is $5,000,000.\\nAMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. The Compensation Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Bonus Plan, in w hole or in part, at any time, including the adoption of amendments deemed necessary or desirable to correct any defect or supply omitted data or reconcile any inconsistency in the Bonus Plan or in any award granted thereunder. The Compensation Committee may amend or modify the Bonus Plan in any respect, or terminate the Bonus Plan, without the consent of any affected participant. However, in no event may such amendment or modification result in an increase in the amount of compensation payable pursuant to any award.\\n \\n \\nPursuant to the Requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the Undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\\n \\n'},\n",

The fair-value calculated expense as determined on the awards\\' grant date is recognized as the requisite service is rendered.\\n \\n(c)\\n       \\nThese adjustments reflect the non-cash compensation expense as measured under APB No. 25 related primarily to restricted stock awarded to the Company\\'s CEO in fiscal 2003 and restricted stock units awarded to selected members of the Company\\'s senior management team in fiscal 2004 and 2005. Note that neither the Company\\'s GAAP nor non-GAAP results of operations in fiscal year 2005 included the accounting impact had the Company chosen to apply the fair-value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R.\\n \\n(d)\\n      \\nAmount reflects the expected tax impact on the above noted non-GAAP adjustments.\\n \\nThe financial guidance provided below is an estimate based on information available as of July 19, 2006. The Company\\'s future performance and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from the guidance set forth below. Some of the factors that could affect the Company\\'s financial results are stated above in this press release.\\nMore information on potential factors that could affect the Company\\'s financial results is included from time to time in the Company\\'s public reports filed with the SEC, including the Company\\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2005, the Company\\'s Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and April 1, 2006, and the Company\\'s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2006 to be filed with the SEC. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.\\n \\n(a)\\n      \\nThese adjustments reconcile the Company\\'s GAAP to its non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company believes that excluding non-cash stock-based compensation provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company\\'s core operating results and facilitates comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company\\'s GAAP results.\\n \\n(b)\\n      \\nReflects the expected non-cash compensation expense attributable to stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan shares. This amount reflects the total estimated expense from the application of SFAS No. 123R, which the Company adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.\\n \\n(c)\\n       \\nThis adjustment represents the expected net of tax impact on earnings per share from the non-GAAP adjustments related to stock-based compensation expense.\\n \\n \\nExhibit 99.2\\n \\n(1)\\n         \\nOther Segments include Asia Pacific and\\nFileMaker\\n.\\n(2)\\n         \\nIncludes iMac, eMac, Mac mini, PowerMac and Xserve product lines.\\n(3)\\n         \\nIncludes MacBook, iBook, MacBook Pro and PowerBook product lines.\\n(4)\\n         \\nConsists of iTunes Music Store sales, iPod services, and Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories.\\n \\nNM:  Not Meaningful\\n \\n'},\n",

A special committee of Apple's outside directors has hired independent counsel to perform an investigation, and the Company has informed the SEC. As a result of the ongoing investigation, the Company will delay the filing of its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2006.\\nAlthough the investigation is ongoing, the Company has discovered additional evidence of irregularities. In light of this, management has concluded, and the audit committee of the board of directors agrees, that the Company will likely need to restate its historical financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants. The Company has not determined the amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which periods may require restatement. Accordingly, the Company today filed a Form 8-K stating that the financial statements and all earnings and press releases and similar communications issued by the Company relating to periods commencing on September 29, 2002 should therefore not be relied upon.\\nThe Company is focused on resolving these issues as quickly as possible and plans to file its Form 10-Q and any required restated financial statements following completion of the investigation.\\nApple ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the Macintosh.

The special committee of outside directors, together with independent counsel and accountants, examined more than 650,000 emails and documents, and conducted interviews with more than 40 current and former employees, directors and advisors. Apple initiated this voluntary independent investigation after a management review discovered irregularities in past stock option grants.\\nThe independent investigation\\'s key findings are:\\nThe investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple\\'s current management team.\\n                   \\nThe most recent evidence of irregularities relates to a January 2002 grant.\\n                   \\nStock option grants made on 15 dates between 1997 and 2002 appear to have grant dates that precede the approval of those grants.\\n                   \\nIn a few instances, Apple CEO Steve Jobs was aware that favorable grant dates had been selected, but he did not receive or otherwise benefit from these grants and was unaware of the accounting implications.\\n                   \\nThe investigation raised serious concerns regarding the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting, recording and reporting of stock option grants.

Mr. Anderson, who served as CFO from 1996 until 2004, informed the company that he believes it is in Apple\\'s best interests that he resign from the board at this time.\\nThe company and its independent auditors are reviewing the findings of the independent investigation.

These preliminary results may be subject to significant adjustment as a result of a likely restatement of historical results.\\nThe Company posted revenue of $4.84 billion and net quarterly profit of $546 million, or  $.62 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $3.68 billion and net profit of $430 million, or $.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 29.2 percent, up from 28.1 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 40 percent of the quarter\\'s revenue.\\nApple shipped 1,610,000 Macintosh computers and 8,729,000 iPods during the quarter, representing 30 percent growth in Macs and 35 percent growth in iPods over the year-ago quarter.\\n\"This strong quarter caps an extraordinary year for Apple. Selling more than 39 million iPods and 5.3 million Macs while performing an incredibly complex architecture transition is something we are all very proud of,\" said Steve Jobs, Apple\\'s CEO. \"Looking forward, 2007 is likely to be one of the most exciting new product years in Apple\\'s history.\"\\n\"We are pleased to have finished the year with over $10 billion in cash and to have increased annual revenue by $11 billion in the last two years,\" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple\\'s CFO. \"Looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2007, we expect revenue of $6.0 to $6.2 billion and earnings per diluted share of $.70 to $.73.\"\\nResults Subject to Significant Adjustment\\nAs previously announced on October 4, 2006, an independent committee investigating Apple\\'s stock option practices has reported its findings, which are under review by the Company and its independent auditors. The investigation determined, among other things, that stock option grants made on 15 dates between 1997 and 2002 appear to have grant dates that precede the approval of those grants for accounting purposes. As a result, management continues to believe, and the audit committee agrees, that Apple will likely need to restate its historical financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expense and related cash and non-cash tax adjustments relating to past stock option grants. The Company and its independent auditors are reviewing accounting guidance regarding stock option grants recently published by the SEC, and have not yet determined the amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which periods may require restatement. Under applicable accounting standards, such compensation expense generally reflects the difference between an option\\'s exercise price and the market price of the Company\\'s stock at the measurement date, the point at which the terms of the option grant were actually finalized. According to the recent SEC guidance, companies must evaluate stock option grants in light of all relevant facts, circumstances and patterns of conduct to determine whether grants were actually finalized on the stated grant dates. Evidence of a practice that certain grants were not finalized on the stated grant date may require a conclusion that the grant date is not the measurement date for other grants as well. Therefore, it is possible that the Company and its independent auditors could conclude that a larger number of grant dates than previously identified could have a measurement date that differs from the grant date, which could result in significant additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Such charges may result in material changes to the Company\\'s financial statements, including those covering the periods presented in this release.\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company\\'s estimated revenue and earnings per share and the potential for significant adjustments to the financial results included in this release. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include the outcome of the pending reviews described above and the likely restatement of the Company\\'s financial statements or results; the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company\\'s reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company\\'s products; possible disruption in commercial activities caused by terrorist activity and armed conflict, such as changes in logistics and security arrangements, and reduced end-user purchases relative to expectations; possible disruption in commercial activity as a result of natural disasters or major health concerns including epidemics; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to successfully evolve its operating system; the potential negative ramifications of the transition of all Macs to Intel microprocessors; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new products with Intel microprocessors and related hardware and software technological changes and innovations to support Intel microprocessors; the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to deliver products based on Intel microprocessors in a timely manner; the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services essential to the Company\\'s business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new programs, products and successful technological innovations to the marketplace; the effect that product quality problems could have on the Company\\'s sales and\\noperating profits; the inventory risk associated with the Company\\'s need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the effect that the Company\\'s dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company\\'s dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company\\'s products; the Company\\'s reliance on the availability of third-party digital content; the Company\\'s dependency on third-party software developers to timely develop future applications that support Intel microprocessors and Power PC microprocessors; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; and risks associated with the Company\\'s retail initiative including significant investment cost, uncertain consumer acceptance and potential impact on existing reseller relationships.

All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to approval of contracts between the Corporation and any of its directors, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of the Corporation or winding up the affairs of the Corporation.\\n5.7\\n                              \\nQuorum\\nThe presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

When any meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if its time and place (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the Corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which the shareholders may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five (45) days or if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting.

In its press release, the Commission stated: \"The Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against Apple based in part on its swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission\\'s investigation.

The Commission accused former General Counsel Nancy R. Heinen of participating in the fraudulent backdating of options granted to Apple\\'s top officers that caused the company to underreport its expenses by nearly $40 million. The Commission\\'s complaint alleges that Heinen, of Portola Valley, Calif., caused Apple to backdate two large options grants to senior executives of Apple  a February 2001 grant of 4.8 million options to Apple\\'s Executive Team and a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs  and altered company records to conceal the fraud.\\nThe Commission also filed, and simultaneously settled, charges against former Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred D. Anderson, of Atherton, Calif., alleging that Anderson should have noticed Heinen\\'s efforts to backdate the Executive Team grant but failed to take steps to ensure that Apple\\'s financial statements were correct. As part of the settlement, Anderson agreed (without admitting or denying the allegations) to pay approximately $3.5 million in disgorgement and penalties.\\nLinda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC\\'s Division of Enforcement, stated, \"The Apple case demonstrates the Commission\\'s ongoing commitment to take action against stock options backdating and other executive compensation abuses. When corporate officers enrich themselves at the expense of a company\\'s shareholders, the Commission will hold the responsible individuals accountable, particularly where, as here, the responsible individuals are among those obligated to ensure that the company complies with all applicable securities laws and that its financial statements are accurate.\"\\nMarc J. Fagel, Associate Regional Director of the SEC\\'s San Francisco Regional Office, stated, \"Apple\\'s shareholders relied on Heinen and Anderson, as respected legal and accounting professionals, to ensure the accurate reporting of the company\\'s executive compensation. Instead, they failed in their duties as gatekeepers and caused Apple to conceal millions of dollars in stock option expenses.\"\\nAccording to the Commission\\'s complaint, filed in the Northern District of California, Apple granted 4.8 million options to six members of its executive team (including Heinen and Anderson) in February 2001. Because the options were in-the-money when granted (i.e. could be exercised to purchase Apple shares at a below market price), Apple was required to report a compensation charge in its publicly filed financial statements. The Commission alleges that, in order to avoid reporting this expense, Heinen caused Apple to backdate options to January 17, 2001, when Apple\\'s share price was substantially lower. Heinen is also alleged to have directed her staff to prepare documents falsely indicating that Apple\\'s Board had approved the Executive Team grant on January 17. As a result, Apple failed to record approximately $18.9 million in compensation expenses associated with the option grant. Anderson, who should have realized the implications of Heinen\\'s actions, failed to disclose key information to Apple\\'s auditors and neglected to ensure that the company\\'s financial statements were accurate. Both Heinen and Anderson personally received millions of dollars in unreported compensation as a result of the backdating.\\nThe Commission\\'s complaint also alleges improprieties in connection with a December 2001 grant of 7.5 million options to CEO Steve Jobs. Although the options were in-the-money at that time, Heinen  as with\\n \\nthe Executive Team grant  caused Apple to backdate the grant to October 19, 2001, when Apple\\'s share price was lower. As a result, the Commission alleges that Heinen caused Apple to improperly fail to record $20.3 million in compensation expense associated with the in-the-money options grant. The Commission further alleges that Heinen then signed fictitious Board minutes stating that the Board had approved the grant to Jobs on October 19 at a \"Special Meeting of the Board of Directors\"  a meeting that, in fact, never occurred.\\nHeinen is charged with, among other things, violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, lying to Apple\\'s auditors, and violating prohibitions on circumventing internal controls. The Commission is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement, and money penalties against Heinen, in addition to an order barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\\nAnderson, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\\'s complaint, has agreed to a permanent injunction from further violations of the antifraud, reporting, internal controls, and other provisions of the federal securities laws. Anderson also will disgorge approximately $3.49 million in ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest, representing the in-the-money portion of the Executive Team options grant that Anderson exercised, and will pay a civil penalty of $150,000.\\nThe Commission also announced today that it would not bring any enforcement action against Apple based in part on its swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission\\'s investigation. Apple\\'s cooperation consisted of, among other things, prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government, and the implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct.\\nFor more information, contact:\\n \\nMarc J.

The amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of Shares received upon exercise of\\n.\\n9\\nSARs shall, in the aggregate, be equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value (on the date of exercise) of the Shares subject to the SARs exceeds the Exercise Price of the Shares.\\nSECTION 8.  \\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK GRANTS.\\n(a)   Time, Amount and Form of Awards   Awards under this Section 8 may be granted in the form of a Stock Grant. A Stock Grant may be awarded in combination with NSOs, and such an Award may provide that the Stock Grant will be forfeited in the event that the related NSOs are exercised.\\n.\\n(b)   Stock Grant Agreement   Each Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Grant Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Each Stock Grant shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in the applicable Stock Grant Agreement. The provisions of the Stock Grant Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical.\\n.\\n(c)   Number of Shares   Each Stock Grant Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the Stock Grant pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.\\n.\\n(a).\\n(d)   Vesting Conditions.   The Committee shall determine the vesting schedule of each Stock Grant. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Stock Grant Agreement which may include performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section 10. Except for any accelerated vesting required or permitted pursuant to Section 12 and except as otherwise provided in the following provisions of this Section 8(d), and subject to such additional vesting requirements or conditions as the Committee may establish with respect to the Award, each Stock Grant under this Plan shall be subject to the following minimum vesting requirements:  (a) if the Stock Grant includes a performance-based vesting condition, the Stock Grant shall not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the Grant Date and vesting shall occur only if the Participant is an Employee or Consultant of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries on such vesting date; and (b) if the Stock Grant does not include a performance-based vesting condition, the Stock Grant shall not vest more rapidly than in monthly installments over the three-year period immediately following the Grant Date and vesting of any vesting installment of the Stock Grant shall occur only if the Participant is an Employee or Consultant of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries on the date such installment is scheduled to vest; provided that the Committee may accelerate or provide in the applicable Award Agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Stock Grant in connection with a change in control of the Participant\\'s employer (or a parent thereof), the termination of the Participant\\'s employment (including a termination of employment due to the Participant\\'s death, disability or retirement, but not including a termination of employment by the Participant\\'s employer for cause), or as consideration or partial consideration for a release by the Participant of pending or threatened claims against the Company, the Participant\\'s employer, or any of their respective officers, directors or other affiliates (regardless of whether the release is given in connection with a termination of employment by the Participant\\'s employer for cause or other circumstances). The Committee may, however, accelerate or provide in the applicable Award Agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Stock Grant, and/or any Restricted Stock Unit Award as provided in Section 9(c), in circumstances not contemplated by the preceding sentence, and/or provide for a vesting schedule for such Stock Grant or Restricted Stock Unit Award that is shorter than the minimum schedule contemplated by the preceding sentence, in such circumstances as the Committee may deem appropriate; provided, however, that the total number of Shares subject to the portion of any such Stock Grant and any such Restricted Stock Unit Award that vests earlier than the minimum vesting dates that would be applicable pursuant to the minimum vesting requirements of the preceding sentence (or, as to any accelerated vesting, provides for accelerated vesting other than in the circumstances contemplated by the preceding sentence) shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the Plan\\'s aggregate Share limit set forth in Section 5\\n \\n10\\n(e)   Voting and Dividend Rights. The holder of a Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall have the same voting, dividend and other rights as the Company\\'s other stockholders, except as otherwise stated in the Stock Grant Agreement. A Stock Grant Agreement may require that the holder of such Stock Grant invest any cash dividends received in additional Shares subject to the Stock Grant. Such additional Shares and any Shares received as a dividend pursuant to the Stock Grant shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Stock Grant with respect to which the dividends were paid.\\nSECTION 9.  \\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.\\n(a)   Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. Each Restricted Stock Unit granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. The provisions of the various Restricted Stock Unit Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical.\\n(b)   Number of Shares. Each Restricted Stock Unit Agreement shall specify the number of Restricted Stock Units to which the Restricted Stock Unit Award pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.\\n(c)   Vesting Conditions. The Committee shall determine the vesting schedule of each Restricted Stock Unit Award. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement which may include performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section 10. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be subject to the same minimum vesting provisions applicable to Stock Grants as set forth in Section 8(d), including (without limitation) the Committee\\'s discretion under the last sentence of Section 8(d) to grant Awards that do not comply with such minimum vesting provisions, subject to the Share limit set forth in such sentence.\\n(d)   Form and Time of Settlement of Restricted Stock Units. Settlement of vested Restricted Stock Units may be made in the form of (i) cash, (ii) Shares or (iii) any combination of both, as determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, in its sole discretion. Vested Restricted Stock Units may be settled in a lump sum or in installments. The distribution may occur or commence when the vesting conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units have been satisfied or have lapsed, or, if the Committee so provides in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, it may be deferred, in accordance with Applicable Laws, to any later date. The amount of a deferred distribution may be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents, as determined by the Committee and provided in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.\\n(e)   Voting and Dividend Rights. The holders of Restricted Stock Units shall have no voting rights. Prior to settlement or forfeiture, any Restricted Stock Unit awarded under the Plan may, at the Committee\\'s discretion, carry with it a right to dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one Share while the Restricted Stock Unit is outstanding. Dividend equivalents may be converted into additional Restricted Stock Units and may be made subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they attach. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, in the form of Shares, or in a combination of both.\\n(f)    Creditors\\' Rights. A holder of Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.\\nSECTION 10.  \\nPERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.\\nGeneral. The Committee may, in its discretion, include performance conditions in an Award. If performance conditions are included in Awards to Covered Employees and such Awards are intended to\\n(a)  \\n11\\nqualify as \"performance-based compensation\" under Code Section 162(m), then such Awards will be subject to the achievement of Performance Goals with respect to a Performance Period established by the Committee. Such Awards shall be granted and administered pursuant to the requirements of Code Section 162(m). Performance Goals shall be adjusted to mitigate the unbudgeted impact of material, unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses, accounting changes or other extraordinary events not foreseen at the time the targets were set unless the Committee provides otherwise at the time of establishing the targets. Before any Shares underlying an Award or any Award payments are released to a Covered Employee with respect to a Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing that the Performance Goals for such Performance Period have been satisfied. Awards with performance conditions that are granted to Participants who are not Covered Employees need not comply with the requirements of Code Section 162(m).\\nCash Bonus Awards. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Cash Bonus Awards under the Plan to one or more Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Cash Bonus Awards shall be subject to performance conditions as described above and, to the extent such Cash Bonus Awards are granted to Covered Persons and intended to qualify as \"performance-based compensation\" under Section 162(m), shall be subject to the requirements of Section 162(m), including without limitation, the establishment of Performance Goals and certification of performance by the Committee as set forth above. In addition, the aggregate amount of compensation to be paid to any one participant in respect of all Cash Bonus Awards payable only in cash and not related to shares of Common Stock and granted to that participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed $5,000,000. Awards that are cancelled during the year shall be counted against this limit to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code.\\n(b)  \\nExpiration of Grant Authority. As required pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Committee\\'s authority to grant new awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (other than Options and SARs with an Exercise Price that is not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date) shall terminate upon the first meeting of the Company\\'s shareholders that occurs in 2012.\\n(c)  \\nSECTION 11.  \\nPROTECTION AGAINST DILUTION.\\n(a)   Adjustments. Subject to Section 12, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to): any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock; then the Committee shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the specific Share limits, maximums and numbers of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Awards, (3) the grant, purchase, or Exercise Price of any outstanding Awards, and/or (4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Awards.\\nUnless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Award Agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraph or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company as an entirety, the Company shall equitably and proportionately adjust the Performance Goals applicable to any then-outstanding performance-based Awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding performance-based Awards.\\n12\\nIt is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding two paragraphs be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code, Section 409A of the Code and Section 162(m) of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\\nWithout limiting the generality of Section 3, any good faith determination by the Committee as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section 11(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\\n(b)   Participant Rights. Except as provided in this Section 11, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issue by the Company of stock of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class. If by reason of an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11 a Participant\\'s Award covers additional or different shares of stock or securities, then such additional or different shares and the Award in respect thereof shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Award and the Shares subject to the Award prior to such adjustment.\\nSECTION 12.  \\nCORPORATE TRANSACTIONS.\\nUpon the occurrence of any of the following: any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company; a sale of all or substantially all the business, stock or assets of the Company; a dissolution of the Company; or any other event in which the Company does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock); then the Committee may make provision for a cash payment in settlement of, or for the assumption, substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Share-based Awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding Share-based Awards, based upon, to the extent relevant under the circumstances, the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock upon or in respect of such event. Upon the occurrence of any event described in the preceding sentence, then, unless the Committee has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the Award or the Award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms in the circumstances, each Award shall terminate upon the related event; provided that the holder of an Option or SAR shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her outstanding vested Options and SARs in accordance with their terms before the termination of such Awards (except that in no case shall more than ten days\\' notice of the impending termination be required.\\nThe Committee may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding Awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of Options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the Exercise Price of the Award.\\nIn any of the events referred to in this Section 12, the Committee may take such action contemplated by this Section 12 prior to such event (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Committee deems the action necessary to permit the Participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying Shares.\\nWithout limiting the generality of Section 3, any good faith determination by the Committee pursuant to its authority under this Section 12 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\\nSECTION 13.  \\nLIMITATIONS ON RIGHTS.\\n(a)   Participant Rights. A Participant\\'s rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with any Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit the individual to participate in\\n13\\nthe Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards. Any Award granted hereunder is not intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant\\'s normal or expected compensation, and in no way represents any portion of a Participant\\'s salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose.\\nNeither the Plan nor any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give any individual a right to remain an employee, consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, or any Subsidiary. The Company and its Parent and Subsidiaries reserve the right to terminate the service of any person at any time, and for any reason, subject to Applicable Laws, the Company\\'s Articlesof Incorporationand Bylaws and any applicable written employment agreement (if any), and such terminated person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any claim to damages or specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any outstanding Award that is forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to any future Award.\\n(b)   Shareholders\\' Rights. Except as provided in Section 9(f), a Participant shall have no dividend rights, voting rights or other rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by his or her Award prior to the issuance of such Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date when such Shares are issued, except as expressly provided in Sections 9(f) and 11.\\n(c)   Regulatory Requirements. Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, the obligation of the Company to issue Shares or other securities under the Plan shall be subject to all Applicable Laws and such approval by any regulatory body as may be required. The Company reserves the right to restrict, in whole or in part, the delivery of Shares or other securities pursuant to any Award prior to the satisfaction of all legal requirements relating to the issuance of such Shares or other securities, to their registration, qualification or listing or to an exemption from registration, qualification or listing. The person acquiring any securities under the Plan will, if requested by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, provide such assurances and representations to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as the Committee may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.\\nSECTION 14.  \\nWITHHOLDING TAXES.\\n(a)   General.

The Company shall have the right to deduct from any amount payable under the Plan, including delivery of Shares to be made pursuant to an Award granted under the Plan, all federal, state, city, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and the Company may take any such actions as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. The Company shall not be required to issue any Shares or make any cash payment under the Plan until such obligations are satisfied.\\n(b)   Share Withholding. The Committee may (i) permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her withholding or income tax obligations by having the Company withhold all or a portion of any Shares that otherwise would be issued to him or her, or (ii) permit a Participant to satisfy such obligations by Cashless Exercise or by surrendering all or a portion of any Shares that he or she previously acquired; provided that Shares withheld or previously owned Shares that are tendered shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company\\'s tax withholding obligations at the minimum statutory withholding rates, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal and state income taxes, payroll taxes and foreign taxes, if applicable, unless the previously owned Shares have been held for a minimum duration determined satisfactory as established by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion. Any payment of taxes by\\n14\\nassigning Shares to the Company may be subject to restrictions, including, but not limited to, any restrictions required by rules of the SEC. If any Shares are used to satisfy withholding taxes, such Shares shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value thereof on the date when the withholding for taxes is required to be made.\\nSECTION 15.  \\nDURATION AND AMENDMENTS; MISCELLANEOUS.\\n(a)   Term of the Plan. The Plan shall terminate on May 10, 2017 and may be terminated on any earlier date pursuant to this Section 15.\\n(b)   Amendment or Termination of the Plan. The Board may, at any time, terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend the Plan, in whole or in part. No awards may be granted during any period that the Board suspends the Plan. To the extent then required by Applicable Laws or required under Sections 162, 422 or 424 of the Code to preserve the intended tax consequences of the Plan, or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board, any amendment to the Plan shall be subject to shareholder approval.\\nAmendments to Awards. Without limiting any other express authority of the Committee under (but subject to) the express limits of the Plan, the Committee by agreement or resolution may waive conditions of or limitations on Awards to Participants that the Committee in the prior exercise of its discretion has imposed, without the consent of a Participant, and (subject to the requirements of Sections 3 and 15(d)) may make other changes to the terms and conditions of Awards. Any amendment or other action that would constitute a Re-Pricing of an Award is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3(b).\\n(c)  \\nLimitations on Amendments to Plan and Awards. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or amendment of any outstanding Award Agreement shall, without written consent of the Participant, affect in any manner materially adverse to the Participant any rights or benefits of the Participant or obligations of the Company under any Award granted under the Plan prior to the effective date of such change. Changes, settlements and other actions contemplated by Section 11 shall not be deemed to constitute changes or amendments for purposes of this Section 15.\\n(d)  \\n(e)   Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law provisions) and applicable U.S. Federal Laws.\\n(f)    Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.\\n(g)   Section Headings. Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.\\n(h)   No Corporate Action Restriction.

The Board of Directors may delegate the management of the day-to-day operation of the business of the Corporation to a management company or other person provided that the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the Board of Directors.\\nCode\\nArticles of Incorporation\\nBylaws\\nNumber\\nThe number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9). The exact number of directors shall be eight (8) until changed within the limits specified above, by a bylaw amending this , duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the shareholders. The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by amendment to these Bylaws duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number less than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written consent, are equal to more than sixteen and two-thirds percent (16-2/3%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. No amendment may change the stated maximum number of authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated minimum number of directors minus one.\\nSection 2.2\\nCompensation\\nDirectors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, and may be reimbursed for expenses, as fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.

Vacancies created by the removal of a director shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of shares holding a majority of the voting power represented and voting a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a least a majority of the voting power required to constitute a quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon.\\nSection 2.6\\nThe shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by removal, shall require the consent of shares holding a majority of the voting power that are entitled to vote thereon.

A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director\\'s term of office.\\nRemoval\\nThe entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected. If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting.

Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.\\nProxies\\nEvery person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person\\'s duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary. No proxy shall be valid (a) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this and applicable law, or (b) after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such proxy is to continue in force. Revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy.

In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation secured by it.\\nNotwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of the Corporation or dies, the debt of the Corporation or the shareholder is paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares or, in the case of uncertificated shares, on the initial transaction statement and written statements. Every form of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also contain an appropr iate space marked \"abstain\", whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her shares on the proposal. A proxy marked \"abstain\" by the shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for or against such proposal. In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder \"withhold\" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.\\nInspectors of Elections\\nBefore any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment.

If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (l) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a shareholder\\'s proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy. These inspectors shall:\\ndetermine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;\\nreceive votes, ballots, or consents;\\nhear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;\\ncount and tabulate all votes or consents;\\ndetermine when the polls shall close;\\ndetermine the result; and\\ndo any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.\\nAdvance Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations\\n(a) Annual Meetings of Shareholders.\\n(i) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the shareholders may be made at an annual meeting of shareholders only (a) pursuant to the Corporation\\'s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, or (c) by any shareholder of the Corporation who was a shareholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 5.14 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting, and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5.14.\\n(ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation and any such proposed business must constitute a proper matter for shareholder action under the Code.

The Company posted revenue of $7.9 billion and net quarterly profit of $1.14 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $6.22 billion and net quarterly profit of $904 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 34.7 percent, up from 33.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 41 percent of the quarter\\'s revenue.\\nIn accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for iPhone and Apple TV over their economic lives. Adjusting GAAP sales and product costs to eliminate the impact of subscription accounting, the corresponding non-GAAP measures* for the quarter are $11.68 billion of \"Adjusted Sales\" and $2.44 billion of \"Adjusted Net Income.\"\\nApple shipped 2,611,000 Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing 21 percent unit growth and 17 percent revenue growth over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 11,052,000 iPods during the quarter, representing eight percent unit growth and three percent revenue growth over the year-ago quarter. Quarterly iPhone units sold were 6,892,000 compared to 1,119,000 in the year-ago-quarter.\\n\"Apple just reported one of the best quarters in its history, with a spectacular performance by the iPhonewe sold more phones than RIM,\" said Steve Jobs, Apple\\'s CEO. \"We don\\'t yet know how this economic downturn will affect Apple.

We are providing a wide range for our guidance, targeting revenue of $9.0 to $10.0 billion and earnings per diluted share between $1.06 and $1.35.\"\\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q4 2008 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple\\'s standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming.

Because the Company may provide unspecified features and additional software products to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for these products on a straight-line basis over their economic lives, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.\\nIn July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined. As a result of this growth in unit sales, the amount of iPhone revenue and product cost that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting increased materially in the quarter ended September 27, 2008.\\nWhile the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company\\'s operations and financial position, management supplements its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: \"Adjusted Sales,\" \"Adjusted Cost of Sales,\" \"Adjusted Gross Margin,\" \"Adjusted Operating Margin,\" \"Adjusted Income before Provision for Income Taxes,\" \"Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes,\" \"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share.\" These financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. The Company uses these financial measures, along with other measures discussed below, to provide additional insight into current operating and business trends not readily apparent from the GAAP results.\\nManagement uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate the Company\\'s growth rate, revenue mix and performance relative to competitors. Given the significant increase in iPhone unit sales during the quarter ended September 27, 2008, Adjusted Sales provides a meaningful measurement of the Company\\'s growth by reflecting amounts generally due to Apple at the time of sale related to products sold within the period. Further, eliminating the effects of deferred revenue (current sales deferred to future periods and prior sales being recognized currently) provides more transparency into the Company\\'s underlying sales trends. Management uses the non-GAAP measures of \"Adjusted Cost of Sales,\" \"Adjusted Gross Margin\" and \"Adjusted Operating Margin\" to measure the Company\\'s operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate on-going operating decisions. Additionally, because the Company recognizes engineering, sales, and marketing expenses as incurred, including expenses related to iPhone and Apple TV, management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate returns on those costs, to manage year-over-year operating expense growth, and to budget future expenses.\\nFurthermore, because they are considered meaningful indicators of current business performance, the non-GAAP measures \"Adjusted Sales\" and \"Adjusted Operating Margin\" are metrics that will factor into the determination of management compensation beginning in fiscal year 2009. Finally, management uses the non-GAAP measures of \"Adjusted Income before Provision for Income Taxes,\" \"Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes,\" \"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\" to measure the Company\\'s operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales, to facilitate on-going operating decisions, and compare performance relative to competitors.\\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding consolidated GAAP measures and related segment information, provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting both the Company\\'s performance and its cash generating potential. Management believes these non-GAAP measures increase the transparency of the Company\\'s current results and enable investors to more fully understand trends in its current and future performance. Beginning with this earnings release, the Company plans to include these non-GAAP measures of financial performance as part of its earnings releases.\\nCautions on Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\nAs noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. These non-GAAP financial measures do not adjust for the costs associated with the Company\\'s intention to provide unspecified new features and software to purchasers of iPhone and Apple TV products. These costs are expensed as incurred under GAAP\\'s subscription accounting model, and are not adjusted in these non-GAAP financial measures. As such, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to reflect in a given period all of the costs of sales made in that period. Rather, the non-GAAP financial measures presented below are intended for the limited purpose of presenting performance measures that include the total sales, related product costs, and resulting income for iPhones and AppleTVs in the period those products are sold to customers.\\nManagement believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company\\'s operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFurther, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company\\'s results to the results of other companies.\\nA reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release.\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements including without limitation those about the Company\\'s estimated revenue and earnings per share. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company\\'s reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company\\'s products; potential litigation from the matters investigated by the special committee of the board of directors and the restatement of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to deliver to the marketplace and stimulate customer demand for new programs, products, and technological innovations on a timely basis; the effect that product transitions, changes in product pricing or mix, and/or increases in component costs could have on the Company\\'s gross margin; the inventory risk associated with the Company\\'s need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the continued availability on acceptable terms, or at all, of certain components and services essential to the Company\\'s business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the effect that the Company\\'s dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company\\'s reliance on the availability of third-party digital content; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; the effect that product and service quality problems could have on the Company\\'s sales and operating profits; the Company\\'s reliance on sole service providers for iPhone in certain countries; war, terrorism, public health issues, and other circumstances that could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products; unfavorable results of other legal proceedings; and the Company\\'s dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company\\'s products.

(the \"Company\") has completed the process it undertook in accordance with its previously announced policy to review the appointment of the Company\\'s independent registered public accounting firm every five years. Pursuant to this policy, the Audit Committee conducted a competitive process to select a firm to serve as the Company\\'s independent registered public accounting firm for the remainder of fiscal 2009. The Audit Committee invited several firms to participate in this process, including KPMG LLP (\"KPMG\"), the Company\\'s independent registered public accounting firm since fiscal 1997.\\nAs a result of this process and following careful deliberation, on February 26, 2009, the Audit Committee engaged Ernst & Young LLP (\"EY\") as the Company\\'s independent registered public accounting firm for the remainder of the fiscal year ending September 26, 2009, and dismissed KPMG from that role.\\nKPMG\\'s audit rep orts on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 29, 2007 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. KPMG\\'s report on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 28, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, did contain separate paragraphs stating: (1) \"effective September 30, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109\"; and (2) \"effective September 25, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment.\" The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.\\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, and in the subsequent interim period through February 26, 2009, there were (i) no disagreements between the Company and KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in their reports on the financial statements for such years, and (ii) no \"reportable events\" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\\nThe Company provided KPMG with a copy of the disclosures it is making in this Current Report on Form 8-K (the \"Report\") prior to the time the Report was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

The Company posted revenue of $8.16 billion and a net quarterly profit of $1.21 billion, or $1.33 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $7.51 billion and net quarterly profit of $1.05 billion, or $1.16 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 36.4 percent, up from 32.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 46 percent of the quarter\\'s revenue.\\nIn accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for iPhone and Apple TV over their estimated economic lives. Adjusting GAAP sales and product costs to eliminate the impact of subscription accounting, the corresponding non-GAAP measures* for the quarter are $9.06 billion of \"Adjusted Sales\" and $1.66 billion of \"Adjusted Net Income.\"\\nApple sold 2.22 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a three percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 11.01 million iPods during the quarter, representing three percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Quarterly iPhone units sold were 3.79 million representing 123 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter.\\n\"We are extremely pleased to report the best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings in our history,\" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple\\'s CFO. \"Apple\\'s financial condition remains very robust, with almost $29 billion in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. Looking ahead to the third fiscal quarter of 2009, we expect revenue in the range of about $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $.95 to $1.00.\"\\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2009 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple\\'s standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming. The live webcast will begin at 2:00 p.m. PDT on April 22, 2009 at and will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.\\nwww.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq209/\\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nDuring fiscal 2007, the Company began selling the iPhone and Apple TV. Because the Company may provide unspecified features and additional software products to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for these products on a straight-line basis over their economic lives, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods sold during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.\\nIn July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and at that time significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined.\\nUnit sales of iPhone 3G continued to be significant in the quarter ended March 28, 2009, with 3.79 million iPhones sold. As a result, the amount of revenue and product cost related to those iPhone sales that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting was substantial. While the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company\\'s operations and financial position, management continues to supplement its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: \"Adjusted Sales,\" \"Adjusted Cost of Sales,\" \"Adjusted Gross Margin,\" \"Adjusted Operating Margin,\" \"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share.\" These financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. The above-mentioned non-GAAP measures are generated by adjusting the related GAAP measures solely to reverse the effect of subscription accounting. The Company uses these financial measures, along with other measures discussed below, to provide additional insight into current operating and business trends not readily apparent from the GAAP results.\\nManagement uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate the Company\\'s growth rate, revenue mix and performance relative to competitors. Given the impact of iPhone unit sales during the quarter ended March 28, 2009, Adjusted Sales provides a meaningful measurement of the Company\\'s growth by reflecting amounts generally due to Apple at the time of sale related to products sold within the period. Further, eliminating the effects of deferred revenue (current sales deferred to future periods and prior sales being recognized currently) provides more transparency into the Company\\'s underlying sales trends. Management uses the non-GAAP measures of \"Adjusted Cost of Sales,\" \"Adjusted Gross Margin\" and \"Adjusted Operating Margin\" to measure the Company\\'s operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate ongoing operating decisions. Additionally, because the Company recognizes engineering, sales, and marketing expenses as incurred, including expenses related to iPhone and Apple TV, management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate returns on those costs, to manage year-over-year operating expense growth, and to budget future expenses. Furthermore, because they are considered meaningful indicators of current business performance, the non-GAAP measures \"Adjusted Sales\" and \"Adjusted Operating Margin\" are metrics that factor into the determination of management compensation beginning in fiscal year 2009. Finally, management uses the non-GAAP measures of \"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\" to measure the Company\\'s operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales, to facilitate ongoing operating decisions, and compare performance relative to competitors.\\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding consolidated GAAP measures and related segment information, provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting both the Company\\'s performance and its cash generating potential. Management believes these non-GAAP measures increase the transparency of the Company\\'s current results and enable investors to more fully understand trends in its current and future performance.\\nCautions on Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\nAs noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. These non-GAAP financial measures do not adjust for the costs associated with the Company\\'s intention to provide unspecified new features and software to purchasers of iPhone and Apple TV products. These costs are expensed as incurred under GAAP\\'s subscription accounting model, and are not adjusted in these non-GAAP financial measures. As such, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to reflect in a given period all of the costs of sales made in that period. Rather, the non-GAAP financial measures presented below are intended for the limited purpose of presenting performance measures that include the total sales, related product costs, and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs in the period those products are sold to customers.\\nManagement believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company\\'s operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFurther, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company\\'s results to the results of other companies.\\nA reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release.\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements including without limitation those about the Company\\'s estimated revenue and earnings per share. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company\\'s reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company\\'s products; potential litigation from the matters investigated by the special committee of the board of directors and the restatement of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to deliver to the marketplace and stimulate customer demand for new programs, products, and technological innovations on a timely basis; the effect that product transitions, changes in product pricing or mix, and/or increases in component costs could have on the Company\\'s gross margin; the inventory risk associated with the Company\\'s need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the continued availability on acceptable terms, or at all, of certain components and services essential to the Company\\'s business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the effect that the Company\\'s dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company\\'s reliance on the availability of third-party digital content and applications; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; the effect that product and service quality problems could have on the Company\\'s sales and operating profits; the Company\\'s reliance on sole service providers for iPhone in certain countries; war, terrorism, public health issues, and other circumstances that could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products; the continued service and availability of key executives and employees; unfavorable results of other legal proceedings; and the Company\\'s dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company\\'s products.

The Board of Directors may delegate the management of the day-to-day operation of the business of the Corporation to a management company or other person provided that the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised under the ultimate direction of the Board of Directors.\\nCode\\nArticles of Incorporation\\nBylaws\\nNumber\\nThe number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9). The exact number of directors shall be eight (8) until changed within the limits specified above, by a bylaw amending this , duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the shareholders.

(\"Apple\") issued a press release regarding Apple\\'s financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2009 and a related data sheet. A copy of Apple\\'s press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and a copy of the related data sheet is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2.\\nThe information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed \"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.\\n \\n \\nThe following exhibits are furnished herewith:\\n \\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\\n \\n \\nExhibit 99.1\\nApple Reports Third Quarter Results\\nBest Non-Holiday Quarter Revenue and Earnings in Apple History\\nCUPERTINO, CaliforniaJuly 21, 2009Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2009 third quarter ended June 27, 2009. The Company posted revenue of $8.34 billion and a net quarterly profit of $1.23 billion, or $1.35 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $7.46 billion and net quarterly profit of $1.07 billion, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 36.3 percent, up from 34.8 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 44 percent of the quarter\\'s revenue.\\nIn accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for iPhone and Apple TV over their estimated economic lives. Adjusting GAAP sales and product costs to eliminate the impact of subscription accounting, the corresponding non-GAAP measures* for the quarter are $9.74 billion of \"Adjusted Sales\" and $1.94 billion of \"Adjusted Net Income.\"\\nApple sold 2.6 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a four percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 10.2 million iPods during the quarter, representing a seven percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly iPhones sold were 5.2 million, representing 626 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter.\\n\"We\\'re making our most innovative products ever and our customers are responding,\" said Steve Jobs, Apple\\'s CEO. \"We\\'re thrilled to have sold over 5.2 million iPhones during the quarter and users have downloaded more than 1.5 billion applications from our App Store in its first year.\"\\n\"We\\'re extremely pleased to report record non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings and quarterly cash flow from operations of $2.3 billion,\" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple\\'s CFO. \"Looking ahead to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, we expect revenue in the range of about $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $1.18 to $1.23.\"\\nApple will provide live streaming of its Q3 2009 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple\\'s standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming. The live webcast will begin at 2:00 p.m. PDT on July 21, 2009 at and will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.\\nwww.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq309/\\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nDuring fiscal 2007, the Company began selling iPhone and Apple TV. Because the Company may provide unspecified features and additional software products to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for these products on a straight-line basis over their economic lives, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods sold during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.\\nIn July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and at that time significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined.\\nIn June 2009, the Company began selling iPhone 3GS, the third-generation iPhone. Unit sales of iPhones continued to be significant in the quarter ended June 27, 2009, with 5.2 million iPhones sold. As a result, the amount of revenue and product cost related to those iPhone sales that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting was substantial. While the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company\\'s operations and financial position, management continues to supplement its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: \"Adjusted Sales,\" \"Adjusted Cost of Sales,\" \"Adjusted Gross Margin,\" \"Adjusted Operating Margin,\" \"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share.\" These financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. The above-mentioned non-GAAP measures are generated by adjusting the related GAAP measures solely to reverse the effect of subscription accounting. The Company uses these financial measures, along with other measures discussed below, to provide additional insight into current operating and business trends not readily apparent from the GAAP results.\\nManagement uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate the Company\\'s growth rate, revenue mix and performance relative to competitors. Given the impact of iPhone unit sales during the quarter ended June 27, 2009, Adjusted Sales provides a meaningful measurement of the Company\\'s growth by reflecting amounts generally due to Apple at the time of sale related to products sold within the period. Further, eliminating the effects of deferred revenue (current sales deferred to future periods and prior sales being recognized currently) provides more transparency into the Company\\'s underlying sales trends. Management uses the non-GAAP measures of \"Adjusted Cost of Sales,\" \"Adjusted Gross Margin\" and \"Adjusted Operating Margin\" to measure the Company\\'s operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate ongoing operating decisions. Additionally, because the Company recognizes engineering, sales, and marketing expenses as incurred, including expenses related to iPhone and Apple TV, management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate returns on those costs, to manage year-over-year operating expense growth, and to budget future expenses. Furthermore, because they are considered meaningful indicators of current business performance, the non-GAAP measures \"Adjusted Sales\" and \"Adjusted Operating Margin\" are metrics that factor into the determination of management compensation beginning in fiscal year 2009. Finally, management uses the non-GAAP measures of \"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\" to measure the Company\\'s operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales, to facilitate ongoing operating decisions, and compare performance relative to competitors.\\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding consolidated GAAP measures and related segment information, provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting both the Company\\'s performance and its cash generating potential. Management believes these non-GAAP measures increase the transparency of the Company\\'s current results and enable investors to more fully understand trends in its current and future performance.\\nCautions on Use of Non-GAAP Measures\\nAs noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. These non-GAAP financial measures do not adjust for the costs associated with the Company\\'s intention to provide unspecified new features and software to purchasers of iPhone and Apple TV products. These costs are expensed as incurred under GAAP\\'s subscription accounting model, and are not adjusted in these non-GAAP financial measures. As such, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to reflect in a given period all of the costs of sales made in that period. Rather, the non-GAAP financial measures presented below are intended for the limited purpose of presenting performance measures that include the total sales, related product costs, and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs in the period those products are sold to customers.\\nManagement believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company\\'s operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFurther, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company\\'s results to the results of other companies.\\nA reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release.\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements including without limitation those about the Company\\'s estimated revenue and earnings per share.

The Company posted revenue of $9.87 billion and a net quarterly profit of $1.67 billion, or $1.82 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $7.9 billion and net quarterly profit of $1.14 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 36.6 percent, up from 34.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 46 percent of the quarter\\'s revenue.\\nIn accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for iPhone and Apple TV over their estimated economic lives. Adjusting GAAP sales and product costs to eliminate the impact of subscription accounting, the corresponding non-GAAP measures* for the quarter are $12.25 billion of \"Adjusted Sales\" and $2.85 billion of \"Adjusted Net Income.\"\\nApple sold 3.05 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a 17 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 10.2 million iPods during the quarter, representing an eight percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones in the quarter, representing seven percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter.\\n\"We are thrilled to have sold more Macs and iPhones than in any previous quarter,\" said Steve Jobs, Apple\\'s CEO. \"We\\'ve got a very strong lineup for the holiday season and some really great new products in the pipeline for 2010.\"\\n\"We are delighted with our September quarter and fiscal 2009 results,\" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple\\'s CFO. \"For the full year, we grew revenue by 12 percent and net income by 18 percent in extraordinarily challenging times.

Because the Company may provide unspecified features and additional software products to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP, specifically FASB ASC 985-605, formerly known as AICPA SOP 97-2, the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for these products on a straight-line basis over their economic lives, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods sold during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.\\nIn July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and at that time significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined.\\nIn June 2009, the Company began selling iPhone 3GS, the third-generation iPhone. Unit sales of iPhones continued to be significant in the quarter ended September 26, 2009, with 7.4 million iPhones sold. As a result, the amount of revenue and product cost related to those iPhone sales that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting was substantial. While the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company\\'s operations and financial position, management continues to supplement its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: \"Adjusted Sales,\" \"Adjusted Cost of Sales,\" \"Adjusted Gross Margin,\" \"Adjusted Operating Margin,\" \"Adjusted Net Income\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share.\" These financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. The above-mentioned non-GAAP measures are generated by adjusting the related GAAP measures solely to reverse the effect of subscription accounting. The Company uses these financial measures, along with other measures discussed below, to provide additional insight into current operating and business trends not readily apparent from the GAAP results.\\nManagement uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate the Company\\'s growth rate, revenue mix and performance relative to competitors.

Apple was required to adopt the new accounting standards no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Apple elected to adopt the new standards during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, as reflected in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 26, 2009, which was filed with the SEC on January 25, 2010. The Company also filed a Form 10-K/A to amend its Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2009 solely to reflect the retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards to the periods presented in that report.\\nAdditionally included in this Form 8-K are selected quarterly financial schedules reflecting the impact of retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards and reconciling the application of old and new accounting principles to historical income statements, balance sheets, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and summary data information. These financial schedules are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and will also be available on the Company\\'s website at .\\nwww.apple.com/investor\\nThe new accounting principles result in the Company\\'s recognition of substantially all of the revenue and product cost for iPhone and Apple TV when those products are delivered to customers. Under historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product\\'s estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV.\\nBecause Apple began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, the Company retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles had been applied in all prior periods. Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised.

The Company believes retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful financial information and better reflects the underlying performance of the Company\\'s business.\\nFor additional information refer to the \"Explanatory Note\" in Apple\\'s Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2009.\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements including without limitation those about the Company\\'s estimated revenue and earnings per share. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company\\'s reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company\\'s products; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to deliver to the marketplace and stimulate customer demand for new programs, products, and technological innovations on a timely basis; the effect that product transitions, changes in product pricing or mix, and/or increases in component costs could have on the Company\\'s gross margin; the inventory risk associated with the Company\\'s need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the continued availability on acceptable terms, or at all, of certain components and services essential to the Company\\'s business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the effect that the Company\\'s dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company\\'s reliance on the availability of third-party digital content and applications; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; the Company\\'s dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company\\'s products; the effect that product and service quality problems could have on the Company\\'s sales and operating profits; the Company\\'s reliance on sole service providers for iPhone in certain countries; the continued service and availability of key executives and employees; war, terrorism, public health issues, and other circumstances that could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products; potential litigation from the matters investigated by the special committee of the board of directors and the restatement of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements; and unfavorable results of other legal proceedings.

(the \"Company\") previously approved, subject to shareholder approval, amendments to the Company\\'s 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the \"2003 Plan\") that would (1) increase the number of shares of the Company\\'s common stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2003 Plan by an additional 36,000,000 shares, and (2) extend the Company\\'s authority to grant awards under the 2003 Plan intended to qualify as \"performance-based awards\" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code through the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. According to the preliminary results from the Company\\'s Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on February 25, 2010 (the \"Annual Meeting\"), the Company\\'s shareholders approved these amendments to the 2003 Plan. The foregoing description of the amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amended version of the 2003 Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.\\n1997 Director Stock Plan Amendments\\nThe Board previously approved, subject to shareholder approval, amendments to the Company\\'s 1997 Director Stock Option Plan, which has been renamed the 1997 Director Stock Plan (the \"Director Plan\"), that would (1) permit the Company to grant awards of restricted stock units under the Director Plan, (2) effective for grants on or after February 25, 2010, replace the automatic initial and annual grants of stock options under the Director Plan with automatic initial and annual grants of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") under the Director Plan, (3) modify the Director Plan\\'s existing share-counting provision so that RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Director Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted, and (4) extend the term of the Director Plan to November 9, 2019. According to the preliminary results from the Annual Meeting, the Company\\'s shareholders approved these amendments to the Director Plan. The foregoing description of the amendments is qualified in its entirety by the text of the amended version of the Director Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.\\n \\nAt the Annual Meeting, management Proposals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were approved, and shareholder Proposals 6 and 7 were not approved. The proposals below are described in detail in the Company\\'s definitive proxy statement dated January 12, 2010 for the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes were counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum was present. Only \"FOR\" and \"AGAINST\" votes were counted for purposes of determining the votes received in connection with each proposal, and therefore broker non-votes and abstentions had no effect on the proposal relating to the election of directors. In the case of each of the other proposals, broker non-votes and abstentions had no effect on determining whether the affirmative vote constituted a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting. Approval of these other proposals also required the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares necessary to constitute a quorum, however, and therefore broker non-votes and abstentions could have prevented the approval of these other proposals because they did not count as affirmative votes.\\nThe results are as follows:\\nProposal 1\\nThe individuals listed below received the highest number of affirmative votes of the outstanding shares of the Company\\'s common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, in each case constituting a majority of the total outstanding shares, and were elected at the Annual Meeting to serve a one-year term on the Board.\\nProposal 2\\nThe management proposal to amend the 2003 Plan, as described in the proxy materials. This proposal was approved with approximately 90.98% of the shares present or represented and voting at the Annual Meeting voting for the proposal and approximately 9.02% of the shares voting against the proposal.\\n \\nProposal 3\\nThe management proposal to amend the Director Plan, as described in the proxy materials. This proposal was approved with approximately 94.36% of the shares present or represented and voting at the Annual Meeting voting for the proposal and approximately 5.64% of the shares voting against the proposal.\\n \\nProposal 4\\nThe management proposal to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation, as described in the proxy materials. This proposal was approved with approximately 99.19% of the shares present or represented and voting at the Annual Meeting voting for the proposal and approximately 0.81% of the shares voting against the proposal.\\n \\nProposal 5\\nThe management proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company\\'s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2010, as described in the proxy materials. This proposal was approved with approximately 99.71% of the shares present or represented and voting at the Annual Meeting voting for the proposal and approximately 0.29% of the shares voting against the proposal.\\n \\nProposal 6\\nThe shareholder proposal requesting that the Board of Directors prepare a sustainability report, as described in the proxy materials. This proposal was defeated with approximately 8.61% of the shares present or represented and voting at the Annual Meeting voting for the proposal and approximately 91.39% of the shares voting against the proposal.\\n \\nProposal 7\\nThe shareholder proposal requesting that the Board amend the Company\\'s bylaws to establish a Board committee on sustainability, as described in the proxy materials. This proposal was defeated with approximately 5.18% of the shares present or represented and voting at the Annual Meeting voting for the proposal and approximately 94.82% of the shares voting against the proposal.\\n \\n \\n \\nThe following exhibits are furnished herewith:\\n \\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\\n \\nExhibit 10.1\\nSECTION 1.\\nINTRODUCTION.\\nOn November 10, 2009, the Board adopted amendments to this 2003 Employee Stock Plan, which shall govern all grants of Awards made after this amendment and restatement, and which shall become effective upon its approval by the Company\\'s stockholders (the \"Effective Date\").

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the total number of Shares subject to SARs that are settled in Shares shall be counted in full against the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, regardless of the number of Shares actually issued upon settlement of the SARs. If Awards are settled in cash, the Shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before vesting or being exercised, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan; provided that any one (1) Share issued pursuant to a Stock Grant or subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan if upon grant, the Shares underlying such forfeited or terminated Awards were counted as two (2) Shares against the Plan reserve. Shares that are exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan. Refer to Section 15(i) for application of the foregoing share limits with respect to substituted awards.\\n \\n(c) Share Limits.\\n(i) Limits on Options and SARs. No Participant shall receive Options or SARs during any Fiscal Year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 15,000,000 Shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11.\\n(ii) Limits on Stock Grants and Restricted Stock Units. No Participant shall receive Stock Grants or Restricted Stock Units during any Fiscal Year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 5,000,000 Shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11.\\n(d) Reservation of Shares; No Fractional Shares. The Company shall at all times reserve a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to cover the Company\\'s obligations and contingent obligations to deliver Shares with respect to Awards then outstanding under the Plan (exclusive of any dividend equivalent obligations to the extent the Company has the right to settle such rights in cash). No fractional Shares shall be delivered under the Plan. The Committee may pay cash in lieu of any fractional Shares in settlements of Awards under the Plan.\\nSECTION 6.\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS.\\n(a) Stock Option Agreement. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Option Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such Option shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan and that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in a Stock Option Agreement. The provisions of the various Stock Option Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. The Stock Option Agreement shall specify whether the Option is an ISO or an NSO.\\n(b) Number of Shares. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the number of Shares that are subject to the Option, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.\\n(c) Exercise Price.

The Exercise Price of an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value (110% for an ISO granted to a 10-Percent Stockholder) on the Grant Date.\\n(d) Exercisability and Term. Each Stock Option Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the Option is to become exercisable and/or any performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section 10 that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. The Stock Option Agreement shall also specify the maximum term of the Option; provided that the maximum term of an Option shall in no event exceed seven (7) years from the Grant Date. A Stock Option Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant\\'s death, Disability or retirement and may provide for tolling of vesting in the event of a Participant\\'s leave of absence. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Stock Option Agreement, no Option can be exercised after the expiration date provided in the applicable Stock Option Agreement.\\n(e) Method of Exercise. An Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company or the Company\\'s designee (or, subject to Applicable Laws and if the Company permits, by electronic or voice methods) of the number of Shares to be purchased. Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the aggregate Exercise Price, plus any required withholdings (unless satisfactory arrangements have been made to satisfy such withholdings). The Company reserves the right to delay issuance of the Shares until the such payment obligations are fully satisfied.\\n(f) Payment for Option Shares. The Exercise Price of an Option shall be paid in cash at the time of exercise, except as follows and if so provided for in the applicable Stock Option Agreement:\\n(i) Cashless Exercise. Payment of all or a part of the Exercise Price may be made through Cashless Exercise.\\n \\n(ii) Other Forms of Payment. Payment may be made in any other form that is consistent with Applicable Laws, regulations and rules and approved by the Committee.\\nIn the case of an ISO granted under the Plan, except to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, payment shall be made only pursuant to the express provisions of the applicable Stock Option Agreement. In the case of an NSO granted under the Plan, the Committee may, in its discretion at any time, accept payment in any form(s) described in this Section 6(f).\\nSECTION 7.\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.\\n(a) SAR Agreement. Each SAR granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a SAR Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such SAR shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. A SAR Agreement may provide for a maximum limit on the amount of any payout notwithstanding the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR. The provisions of the various SAR Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical.\\n(b) Number of Shares. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.\\n(c) Exercise Price. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the Exercise Price, which is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11. A SAR Agreement may specify an Exercise Price that varies in accordance with a predetermined formula while the SAR is outstanding, provided that in all cases the Exercise Price of a SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date.\\n(d) Exercisability and Term. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the SAR is to become exercisable and/or any performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section 10 that must be satisfied before the SAR is exercised. The SAR Agreement shall also specify the maximum term of the SAR which shall not exceed seven (7) years from the Grant Date. A SAR Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant\\'s death, Disability or retirement and may provide for tolling of vesting in the event of a Participant\\'s leave of absence. SARs may be awarded in combination with Options or Stock Grants, and such an Award shall provide that the SARs will not be exercisable unless the related Options or Stock Grants are forfeited. A SAR may be included in an ISO only at the time of grant but may be included in an NSO at the time of grant or at any subsequent time, but not later than six months before the expiration of such NSO. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the SAR Agreement, no SAR can be exercised after the expiration date provided in the applicable SAR Agreement.\\n(e) Exercise of SARs. Upon exercise of a SAR, the Participant (or any person having the right to exercise the SAR after Participant\\'s death) shall receive from the Company (i) Shares, (ii) cash or (iii) any combination of Shares and cash, as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant of the SAR, in its sole discretion. The amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of Shares received upon exercise of SARs shall, in the aggregate, be equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value (on the date of exercise) of the Shares subject to the SARs exceeds the Exercise Price of the Shares.\\nSECTION 8.\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR STOCK GRANTS.\\n(a) Time, Amount and Form of Awards. Awards under this Section 8 may be granted in the form of a Stock Grant. A Stock Grant may be awarded in combination with NSOs, and such an Award may provide that the Stock Grant will be forfeited in the event that the related NSOs are exercised.\\n(b) Stock Grant Agreement. Each Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Grant Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Each Stock Grant shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in the applicable Stock Grant Agreement. The provisions of the Stock Grant Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical.\\n \\n(c) Number of Shares. Each Stock Grant Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the Stock Grant pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.\\n(d) Vesting Conditions. The Committee shall determine the vesting schedule of each Stock Grant. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Stock Grant Agreement which may include performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section 10. Except for any accelerated vesting required or permitted pursuant to Section 12 and except as otherwise provided in the following provisions of this Section 8(d), and subject to such additional vesting requirements or conditions as the Committee may establish with respect to the Award, each Stock Grant under this Plan shall be subject to the following minimum vesting requirements: (a) if the Stock Grant includes a performance-based vesting condition, the Stock Grant shall not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the Grant Date and vesting shall occur only if the Participant is an Employee or Consultant of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries on such vesting date; and (b) if the Stock Grant does not include a performance-based vesting condition, the Stock Grant shall not vest more rapidly than in monthly installments over the three-year period immediately following the Grant Date and vesting of any vesting installment of the Stock Grant shall occur only if the Participant is an Employee or Consultant of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries on the date such installment is scheduled to vest; provided that the Committee may accelerate or provide in the applicable Award Agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Stock Grant in connection with a change in control of the Participant\\'s employer (or a parent thereof) or the termination of the Participant\\'s employment due to the Participant\\'s death, disability or retirement. The Committee may, however, accelerate or provide in the applicable Award Agreement for the accelerated vesting of any Stock Grant, and/or any Restricted Stock Unit Award as provided in Section 9(c), in circumstances not contemplated by the preceding sentence, and/or provide for a vesting schedule for such Stock Grant or Restricted Stock Unit Award that is shorter than the minimum schedule contemplated by the preceding sentence, in such circumstances as the Committee may deem appropriate; provided, however, that the total number of Shares subject to the portion of any such Stock Grant and any such Restricted Stock Unit Award that vests earlier than the minimum vesting dates that would be applicable pursuant to the minimum vesting requirements of the preceding sentence (or, as to any accelerated vesting, provides for accelerated vesting other than in the circumstances contemplated by the preceding sentence) shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the Plan\\'s aggregate Share limit set forth in Section 5(a).\\n(e) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holder of a Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall have the same voting, dividend and other rights as the Company\\'s other stockholders, except as otherwise stated in the Stock Grant Agreement. A Stock Grant Agreement may require that the holder of such Stock Grant invest any cash dividends received in additional Shares subject to the Stock Grant. Such additional Shares and any Shares received as a dividend pursuant to the Stock Grant shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Stock Grant with respect to which the dividends were paid.\\nSECTION 9.\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.\\n(a) Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. Each Restricted Stock Unit granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. The provisions of the various Restricted Stock Unit Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical.\\n(b) Number of Shares. Each Restricted Stock Unit Agreement shall specify the number of Restricted Stock Units to which the Restricted Stock Unit Award pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 11.\\n(c) Vesting Conditions. The Committee shall determine the vesting schedule of each Restricted Stock Unit Award. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement which may include performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to\\n \\nSection 10. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be subject to the same minimum vesting provisions applicable to Stock Grants as set forth in Section 8(d), including (without limitation) the Committee\\'s discretion under the last sentence of Section 8(d) to grant Awards that do not comply with such minimum vesting provisions, subject to the Share limit set forth in such sentence.\\n(d) Form and Time of Settlement of Restricted Stock Units. Settlement of vested Restricted Stock Units may be made in the form of (i) cash, (ii) Shares or (iii) any combination of both, as determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, in its sole discretion. Vested Restricted Stock Units may be settled in a lump sum or in installments. The distribution may occur or commence when the vesting conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units have been satisfied or have lapsed, or, if the Committee so provides in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, it may be deferred, in accordance with Applicable Laws, to any later date. The amount of a deferred distribution may be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents, as determined by the Committee and provided in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.\\n(e) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holders of Restricted Stock Units shall have no voting rights. Prior to settlement or forfeiture, any Restricted Stock Unit awarded under the Plan may, at the Committee\\'s discretion, carry with it a right to dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one Share while the Restricted Stock Unit is outstanding. Dividend equivalents may be converted into additional Restricted Stock Units and may be made subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they attach. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, in the form of Shares, or in a combination of both.\\n(f) Creditors\\' Rights. A holder of Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.\\nSECTION 10.\\nPERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS; CASH BONUS AWARDS.\\n(a) General. The Committee may, in its discretion, include performance conditions in an Award. If performance conditions are included in Awards to Covered Employees and such Awards are intended to qualify as \"performance-based compensation\" under Code Section 162(m), then such Awards will be subject to the achievement of Performance Goals with respect to a Performance Period established by the Committee. Such Awards shall be granted and administered pursuant to the requirements of Code Section 162(m). Performance Goals shall be adjusted to mitigate the unbudgeted impact of material, unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses, accounting changes or other extraordinary events not foreseen at the time the targets were set unless the Committee provides otherwise at the time of establishing the targets. Before any Shares underlying an Award or any Award payments are released to a Covered Employee with respect to a Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing that the Performance Goals for such Performance Period have been satisfied. Awards with performance conditions that are granted to Participants who are not Covered Employees need not comply with the requirements of Code Section 162(m).\\n(b) Cash Bonus Awards. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Cash Bonus Awards under the Plan to one or more Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Cash Bonus Awards may be subject to performance conditions as described in Section 10(a) above and, to the extent such Cash Bonus Awards are granted to Covered Persons and intended to qualify as \"performance-based compensation\" under Section 162(m), shall be subject to the requirements of Section 162(m), including without limitation, the establishment of Performance Goals and certification of performance by the Committee as set forth above. In addition, the aggregate amount of compensation to be paid to any one participant in respect of all Cash Bonus Awards payable only in cash and not related to shares of Common Stock and granted to that participant in any one calendar year shall not exceed $5,000,000. Awards that are cancelled during the year shall be counted against this limit to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code.\\n \\n(c) Expiration of Grant Authority. As required pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Committee\\'s authority to grant new awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (other than Options and SARs with an Exercise Price that is not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date) shall terminate upon the first meeting of the Company\\'s shareholders that occurs in 2015.\\nSECTION 11.\\nPROTECTION AGAINST DILUTION.\\n(a) Adjustments. Subject to Section 12, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to): any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock; then the Committee shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the specific Share limits, maximums and numbers of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Awards, (3) the grant, purchase, or Exercise Price of any outstanding Awards, and/or (4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Awards.\\nUnless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Award Agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraph or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company as an entirety, the Company shall equitably and proportionately adjust the Performance Goals applicable to any then-outstanding performance-based Awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding performance-based Awards.\\nIt is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding two paragraphs be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code, Section 409A of the Code and Section 162(m) of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\\nWithout limiting the generality of Section 3, any good faith determination by the Committee as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section 11(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\\n(b) Participant Rights. Except as provided in this Section 11, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issue by the Company of stock of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class. If by reason of an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11 a Participant\\'s Award covers additional or different shares of stock or securities, then such additional or different shares and the Award in respect thereof shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Award and the Shares subject to the Award prior to such adjustment.\\nSECTION 12.\\nCORPORATE TRANSACTIONS.\\nUpon the occurrence of any of the following: any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company; a sale of all or substantially all the business, stock or assets of the Company; a dissolution of the Company; or any other event in which the Company does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock); then the Committee may make provision for a cash payment in settlement of, or for the assumption, substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Share-based Awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the\\n \\nholder of any or all outstanding Share-based Awards, based upon, to the extent relevant under the circumstances, the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock upon or in respect of such event. Upon the occurrence of any event described in the preceding sentence, then, unless the Committee has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the Award or the Award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms in the circumstances, each Award shall terminate upon the related event; provided that the holder of an Option or SAR shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her outstanding vested Options and SARs in accordance with their terms before the termination of such Awards (except that in no case shall more than ten days\\' notice of the impending termination be required).\\nThe Committee may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding Awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of Options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the Exercise Price of the Award.\\nIn any of the events referred to in this Section 12, the Committee may take such action contemplated by this Section 12 prior to such event (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Committee deems the action necessary to permit the Participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying Shares.\\nWithout limiting the generality of Section 3, any good faith determination by the Committee pursuant to its authority under this Section 12 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\\nSECTION 13.\\nLIMITATIONS ON RIGHTS.\\n(a) Participant Rights. A Participant\\'s rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with any Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit the individual to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards. Any Award granted hereunder is not intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant\\'s normal or expected compensation, and in no way represents any portion of a Participant\\'s salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose.\\nNeither the Plan nor any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give any individual a right to remain an employee, consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, or any Subsidiary. The Company and its Parent and Subsidiaries reserve the right to terminate the service of any person at any time, and for any reason, subject to Applicable Laws, the Company\\'s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any applicable written employment agreement (if any), and such terminated person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any claim to damages or specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any outstanding Award that is forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to any future Award.\\n(b) Shareholders\\' Rights. Except as provided in Section 9(f), a Participant shall have no dividend rights, voting rights or other rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by his or her Award prior to the issuance of such Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date when such Shares are issued, except as expressly provided in Sections 9(f) and 11.\\n(c) Regulatory Requirements. Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, the obligation of the Company to issue Shares or other securities under the Plan shall be subject to all Applicable Laws and such approval by any regulatory body as may be required. The Company reserves the right to restrict, in whole or in\\n \\npart, the delivery of Shares or other securities pursuant to any Award prior to the satisfaction of all legal requirements relating to the issuance of such Shares or other securities, to their registration, qualification or listing or to an exemption from registration, qualification or listing. The person acquiring any securities under the Plan will, if requested by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, provide such assurances and representations to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as the Committee may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.\\nSECTION 14.\\nWITHHOLDING TAXES.\\n(a) General. A Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise in connection with his or her Award. The Company shall have the right to deduct from any amount payable under the Plan, including delivery of Shares to be made pursuant to an Award granted under the Plan, all federal, state, city, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment and the Company may take any such actions as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. The Company shall not be required to issue any Shares or make any cash payment under the Plan until such obligations are satisfied.\\n(b) Share Withholding. The Committee may (i) permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of his or her withholding or income tax obligations by having the Company withhold all or a portion of any Shares that otherwise would be issued to him or her, or (ii) permit a Participant to satisfy such obligations by Cashless Exercise or by surrendering all or a portion of any Shares that he or she previously acquired; provided that Shares withheld or previously owned Shares that are tendered shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company\\'s tax withholding obligations at the minimum statutory withholding rates, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal and state income taxes, payroll taxes and foreign taxes, if applicable, unless the previously owned Shares have been held for a minimum duration determined satisfactory as established by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion. Any payment of taxes by assigning Shares to the Company may be subject to restrictions, including, but not limited to, any restrictions required by rules of the SEC. If any Shares are used to satisfy withholding taxes, such Shares shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value thereof on the date when the withholding for taxes is required to be made.\\nSECTION 15.\\nDURATION AND AMENDMENTS; MISCELLANEOUS.\\n(a) Term of the Plan. The Plan shall terminate on May 10, 2017 and may be terminated on any earlier date pursuant to this Section 15.\\n(b) Amendment or Termination of the Plan. The Board may, at any time, terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend the Plan, in whole or in part. No awards may be granted during any period that the Board suspends the Plan. To the extent then required by Applicable Laws or required under Sections 162, 422 or 424 of the Code to preserve the intended tax consequences of the Plan, or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board, any amendment to the Plan shall be subject to shareholder approval.\\n(c) Amendments to Awards. Without limiting any other express authority of the Committee under (but subject to) the express limits of the Plan, the Committee by agreement or resolution may waive conditions of or limitations on Awards to Participants that the Committee in the prior exercise of its discretion has imposed, without the consent of a Participant, and (subject to the requirements of Sections 3 and 15(d)) may make other changes to the terms and conditions of Awards. Any amendment or other action that would constitute a Re-Pricing of an Award is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3(b).\\n(d) Limitations on Amendments to Plan and Awards. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or amendment of any outstanding Award Agreement shall, without written consent of the Participant, affect in any manner materially adverse to the Participant any rights or benefits of the Participant or obligations of the Company under any Award granted under the Plan prior to the effective date of such change. Changes, settlements and other actions contemplated by Section 11 shall not be deemed to constitute changes or amendments for purposes of this Section 15.\\n \\n(e) Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law provisions) and applicable U.S. Federal Laws.\\n(f) Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.\\n(g) Section Headings. Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.\\n(h) No Corporate Action Restriction. The existence of the Plan, the Award Agreements and the Awards granted hereunder shall not limit, affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Board or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize: (i) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the capital structure or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iv) any dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Subsidiary, (v) any sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (vi) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Company or any Subsidiary. No Participant, beneficiary or any other person shall have any claim under any Award or Award agreement against any member of the Board or the Committee, or the Company or any employees, officers or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action.\\n(i) Stock-Based Awards in Substitution for Stock Options or Awards Granted by Other Company. Awards may be granted under the Plan in substitution for or in connection with an assumption of employee, director and/or consultant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other stock-based awards granted by other entities to persons who are or who will become Employees or Consultants in respect of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries in connection with a distribution, merger or other reorganization by or with the granting entity or an affiliated entity, or the acquisition by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of all or a substantial part of the stock or assets of the granting entity. The Awards so granted may reflect the original terms of the related award being assumed or substituted for and need not comply with other specific terms of the Plan, with Common Stock substituted for the securities covered by the original award and with the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such awards, as well as any exercise or purchase prices applicable to such awards, adjusted to account for differences in stock prices in connection with the transaction. Any shares that are delivered and any Awards that are granted by, or become obligations of, the Company, as a result of any such assumption or substitution in connection with any such transaction shall not be counted against the Share limit or other limits on the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan.\\n \\nExhibit 10.2\\nOn November 10, 2009, the Board adopted this amended and restated 1997 Director Stock Plan (formerly known as the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan and as renamed, the \"Plan\"), which shall govern all grants of Awards made after this amendment and restatement, and which shall become effective upon its approval by the Company\\'s shareholders (the \"Effective Date\"). For the terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to Awards granted before the Effective Date, refer to the version of the Plan in effect as of the date such Award was granted.\\n1. . The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals by granting such individuals Awards to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock.\\nPURPOSES\\n2. . The Administrator will be responsible for administering the Plan. The Administrator will have authority to adopt such rules as it may deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan, and shall have authority to interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan and any agreements and notices under the Plan and to make determinations pursuant to any Plan provision. Each interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons. The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company\\'s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from time to time.\\nADMINISTRATION\\n3. .\\nSHARES AVAILABLE\\n(a) . Subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 1,600,000 shares (the \"Share Limit\"). Either authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock or treasury shares may be delivered pursuant to the Plan.\\nSHARE LIMIT\\n(b) . Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards will count against the Share Limit as two (2) shares for every one (1) share issued in connection with the Award. Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options will count against the Share Limit as one (1) share for every one (1) share to which such exercise relates.

Any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section 8(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\\n(b) It is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by Section 8(a) be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 409A of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.\\n9. .\\nCORPORATE TRANSACTIONS\\n(a) Upon the occurrence of any of the following: any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company; a sale of all or substantially all the business, stock or assets of the Company; a dissolution of the Company; or any other event in which the Company does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Stock); then the Administrator may make provision for a cash payment in settlement of, or for the assumption, substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding Awards, based upon, to the extent relevant under the circumstances, the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock upon or in respect of such event. Upon the occurrence of any event described in the preceding sentence, then, unless the Administrator has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the Award or the Award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms in the circumstances, each Award shall terminate upon the related event; provided that the holders of outstanding Options shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise their outstanding vested Options in accordance with their terms before the termination of such Options (except that in no case shall more than ten days\\' notice of the impending termination be required).\\n(b) The Administrator may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding Awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of Options and without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess (if any) of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise price of the Option. In any of the events referred to in this Section 9, the Administrator may take such action contemplated by this Section 9 prior to such event (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Administrator deems the action necessary to permit the Non-Employee Director to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying shares. Without limiting the generality of Section 2, any good faith determination by the Administrator pursuant to its authority under this Section 9 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.\\n \\n10. .\\nTERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN\\n(a) . Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate on November 9, 2019. Following such date, no further grants of Awards shall be made pursuant to the Plan.\\nTERMINATION\\n(b) .

For avoidance of doubt, the Board may, without shareholder approval, provide on a prospective basis for grants under the Plan to consist of Options only, Restricted Stock Unit Awards only, or a combination of Options and Restricted Stock Unit Awards on such terms and conditions, subject to the Share Limit of Section 3 and the other express limits of the Plan, as may be established by the Board.\\nGENERAL POWER OF BOARD\\n(c) . The Board may not alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan or amend the terms of any outstanding Award without the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely affect his or her rights with respect to Awards that have previously been granted.\\nWHEN NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS\\' CONSENTS REQUIRED\\n(d) . Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in any agreement evidencing any Option, in no case (except due to an adjustment contemplated by Section 8 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with respect to the Plan or any Option hereunder that would constitute a repricing (by amendment, substitution, cancellation and regrant, exchange or other means) of the per share exercise price of any Option.\\nNO REPRICING\\n11. .\\nMISCELLANEOUS\\n(a) .

No shares of Common Stock shall be issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.\\nSECURITIES LAW RESTRICTIONS\\n(c) . The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.\\nEXPENSES\\n \\n(d) . Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.\\nAPPLICABLE LAW\\n(e) .

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers\\n \\n(e) Compensatory Arrangements with Certain Officers.\\nOn May 24, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the \"Committee\") of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. (the \"Company\") approved amendments to each outstanding and unvested restricted stock unit award granted by the Company to its employees (other than Timothy D. Cook, the Company\\'s Chief Executive Officer). The amendments provide that if the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its common stock, each award will be credited with an amount equal to the per-share cash dividend paid by the Company, multiplied by the total number of restricted stock units subject to the award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for such dividend. The amounts that are credited to each award are referred to as \"dividend equivalents.\" Any dividend equivalents credited to an award will be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms and conditions as the unvested restricted stock units to which the dividend equivalents relate. Depending on the domicile of the employee, accumulated dividend equivalents will either be paid in cash or used to offset employee taxes due upon vesting of the restricted stock units.\\nThe Committee determined these amendments were appropriate in light of the Company\\'s announcement on March 19, 2012 that it intends to commence paying ordinary cash dividends of $2.65 per share to its shareholders on a quarterly basis sometime during the fourth quarter of its 2012 fiscal year. As restricted stock units are not outstanding shares of common stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate in such dividends, the crediting of dividend equivalents is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the awards were granted and to treat the award holders consistently with shareholders.\\nAt Mr. Cook\\'s request, none of his restricted stock units will participate in dividend equivalents. Assuming a quarterly dividend of $2.65 per share over the vesting periods of his 1.125 million outstanding restricted stock units, Mr. Cook will forego approximately $75 million in dividend equivalent value.\\n \\n \\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\\n \\n'},\n",

The Company expects to utilize a total of $100 billion of cash under the expanded program by the end of calendar 2015. This represents a $55 billion increase to the program announced last year and translates to an average rate of $30 billion per year from the time of the first dividend payment in August 2012 through December 2015.\\nAs part of this program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $60 billion from the $10 billion level announced last year. This is the largest single share repurchase authorization in history and is expected to be executed by the end of calendar 2015.

(the \"Company\") is filing herewith updated financial statements and other affected financial information for the periods included in the Company\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012. These financial statements and other affected financial information have been updated to reflect changes made in fiscal year 2013 to the Company\\'s reportable operating segment data and categorization of product-level net sales reporting, and the presentation of comprehensive income as a separate financial statement.\\nIn fiscal year 2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in the Asia-Pacific segment. As a result of this change, the Company now has the following reportable operating segments: Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific, and Retail. Additionally, the Company began allocating certain manufacturing costs and variances, including costs related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, to its operating segments, instead of classifying these costs and variances in other corporate expenses.\\nIn fiscal year 2013, the Company adopted amended accounting standards that change the presentation of comprehensive income. These standards increase the prominence of other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in shareholders\\' equity and requires the components of OCI to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements. The amended accounting standards only impact the financial statement presentation of OCI and do not change the components that are recognized in net income or OCI; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the Company\\'s financial position or results of operations.\\nPursuant to guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), the Company has updated the applicable items that were contained in the Company\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012, (\"Form 10-K\") reflecting the above mentioned changes in Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in Exhibits No. 99.1 and No. 99.2 filed in this Current Report on Form 8-K (\"Form 8-K\"), respectively. The information included in this Form 8-K is presented for information purposes only in connection with the change in the Company\\'s reportable operating segment data and the other items referred to above. There is no change to the Company\\'s previously reported Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholders\\' Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in the Form 10-K.\\n \\n \\nThe following exhibits are furnished herewith:\\n \\n \\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nExhibit 23.1\\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Forms S-8 (333-184706, 333-180981, 333-179189, 333-75930, 333-125148, 333-146026, 333-165214, and 333-168279) pertaining to various stock incentive plans of Apple Inc. of our report dated October 31, 2012 (except for the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 8Segment Information and Geographic Data, as to which the date is April 24, 2013) with respect to the consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc., included in this Current Report on Form 8-K.\\nSan Jose, California\\nApril 24, 2013\\nExhibit 99.1\\n \\nThis Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and other parts of this Current Report on Form 8-K (\"Form 8-K\") contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as \"future,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"predicts,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"may,\" and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\\'s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012 (\"Form 10-K\") under the heading \"Risk Factors,\" which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 8-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company\\'s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\\'s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the \"Company\" and \"Apple\" as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nExecutive Overview\\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company\\'s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and OS X operating systems, iCloud, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company also sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and government customers.\\nThe Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, and services. The Company\\'s business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative design. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. As part of the iTunes Store, the Company\\'s App Store and iBookstore allow customers to discover and download applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through \"iOS devices,\" namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The Company\\'s Mac App Store allows customers to easily discover, download and install Mac applications. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that complement the Company\\'s offerings. The Company\\'s strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience.\\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including the market for mobile communications and media devices with its iOS devices; personal computers with its Mac computers; portable digital players with iPod; and distribution of third-party digital content and applications with the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that continual investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. The Company\\'s research and development spending is focused on investing in new hardware and software products, and in further developing its existing products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod hardware; iOS and OS X operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services.\\n \\nThe Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and the Company\\'s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\\'s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 8-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.\\nManagement believes the Company\\'s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\\'s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\\'s Board of Directors.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\\'s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.\\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\\'s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\\'s essential software, and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\"VSOE\"), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (\"TPE\") and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\"ESP\"). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\\n \\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\\'s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\\'s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years.\\nThe Company\\'s process for determining ESPs involves management\\'s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services or the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided, or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company\\'s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change.\\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\\'s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\\'s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\\'s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\\'s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations.\\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities\\nThe Company\\'s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\\'s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\\'s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\\'s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis. The Company\\'s assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.\\n \\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments\\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company\\'s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.\\nThe Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company\\'s requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\\'s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\\'s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.\\nWarranty Costs\\nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\\'s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\\'s results of operations.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results.\\n \\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of the Form 10-K under the heading \"Legal Proceedings\" and in this Form 8-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 7, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\\'s expectations, the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on September 29, 2012, September 24, 2011, and September 25, 2010, respectively. Fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14\\nth\\nweek included in the first quarter of 2012, as is done approximately every six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters. Inclusion of the additional week in 2012 increased the Company\\'s overall net sales and operating expenses for the year. Fiscal years 2011 and 2010 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\\'s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.\\nNet Sales\\nIn 2013, the Company made certain changes to the presentation of its operating segment data and product-level net sales, as described below. The 2012, 2011 and 2010 presentation of this data has been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.\\nIn 2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in its Asia-Pacific segment. The Company\\'s reportable operating segments now consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail operations.\\nIn 2013, the Company realigned its reporting of product-level net sales. Reported net sales of the Company\\'s hardware categories no longer include related service and accessory revenue. The Company also began reporting separate categories for iTunes, software and services, and for accessories.\\n \\nThe following table shows net sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during 2012, 2011, and 2010 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFiscal Year 2012 versus 2011\\nNet sales during 2012 increased $48.3 billion or 45% compared to 2011. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the addition of a 14\\nth\\nweek in the first quarter of 2012, as well as the following:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPartially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in iPod net sales experienced across all operating segments. iPod net sales were $5.6 billion in 2012, a decrease of $1.8 billion or 25% compared to 2011. Similarly, iPod unit sales decreased by 17% in 2012 compared to 2011. Declines in net sales and unit sales of iPod reflect the continuing contraction of the overall market for MP3 players. Net sales of iPod accounted for 4% and 7% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to holiday seasonal demand. Actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions by the Company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the Company in any particular quarter. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company\\'s future net sales or financial performance.\\nGrowth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. The net sales growth during the first six months of 2012 reflects the launch of iPhone 4S in the first quarter of 2012 and the Company\\'s ability to meet demand more quickly for iPhone 4S when compared to the iPhone 4 launch. Growth during the first half of 2012 was also favorably impacted by the addition of a 14\\nth\\nweek in the first quarter of 2012 and strong unit sales of iPad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in iPad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011.\\nFiscal Year 2011 versus 2010\\nNet sales during 2011 increased $43.0 billion or 66% compared to 2010. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPartially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in iPod net sales of $821 million or 10% during 2011 compared to 2010. Similarly, iPod unit sales decreased by 15% in 2011 compared to 2010. Net sales of iPod accounted for 7% and 13% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nSegment Operating Performance\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\\'s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan and those countries included in the Greater China segment. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company\\'s operating segments may be found in this Form 8-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 8, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data.\"\\nAmericas\\nNet sales in the Americas segment increased $19.2 billion or 50% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, and higher sales from the iTunes Store. The Americas segment represented 37% and 35% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nNet sales in the Americas segment increased $13.8 billion or 56% during 2011 compared to 2010. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant year-over-year increase in iPhone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4 and increased sales of iPad and Mac, partially offset by a decrease in iPod sales. Higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store also drove an increase in net sales during 2011. The Americas segment represented 35% and 37% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\n \\nEurope\\nNet sales in the Europe segment increased $8.5 billion or 31% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the iTunes Store and increased demand for iPhone from the launch of iPhone 4S. iPhone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the Europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and therefore did not contribute to the growth in net sales in the Europe segment to the same extent as it did in the Americas, Greater China and Japan segments. Net sales in the Europe segment were also negatively impacted by the region\\'s uncertain economic conditions and the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to several European currencies, including the euro. The Europe segment represented 23% and 26% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nNet sales in the Europe segment increased $9.1 billion or 49% during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in net sales during 2011 was attributable primarily to the continued year-over-year increase in iPhone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4, and increased sales of iPad and Mac, partially offset by a decrease in iPod sales. The Europe segment represented 26% and 29% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nGreater China\\nNet sales in the Greater China segment increased $9.8 billion or 78% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iPhone from the launch of iPhone 4S and strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2. Growth in the Greater China segment was affected by the timing of iPhone and iPad product launches. iPhone 5 was not launched in China during 2012, and the new iPad that was introduced by the Company in March 2012 was not launched in China until the fourth quarter of 2012. The Greater China segment represented 14% and 12% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nNet sales in the Greater China segment increased $9.7 billion or 320% during 2011 compared to 2010. The growth in net sales during 2011 was due primarily to particularly strong demand for iPhone and iPad, and increased sales of Mac. The Greater China segment represented 12% and 5% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nJapan\\nNet sales in the Japan segment increased $5.1 billion or 94% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, expanded distribution with a new iPhone carrier, strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the iTunes Store, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The Japan segment represented 7% and 5% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nNet sales in the Japan segment increased $1.5 billion or 37% during 2011 compared to 2010. The key contributors to Japan\\'s net sales growth were increased iPhone sales, strong sales of iPad, increased sales of Mac, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The Japan segment represented 5% and 6% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nRest of Asia Pacific\\nNet sales in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment increased $839 million or 8% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to strong demand for the new iPad. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment experienced significantly lower year-over-year growth in net sales compared to all of the Company\\'s other operating segments due primarily to a decrease in iPhone sales. This decrease reflects the timing of iPhone 5 launches in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment, which only occurred in a limited number of countries during the fourth quarter of 2012. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment represented 7% and 9% of the Company\\'s total net sales in both 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nNet sales in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment increased $4.7 billion or 89% during 2011 compared to 2010. Higher net sales in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iPhone sales given the strong demand for iPhone 4 and carrier expansion, strong sales of iPad, and increased Mac sales. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment represented 9% and 8% of the Company\\'s total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\n \\nRetail\\nNet sales in the Retail segment increased $4.7 billion or 33% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, and higher Mac net sales. The lower year-over-year growth in net sales experienced by the Retail segment during 2012 compared to the Company\\'s overall growth rate reflects the significant expansion in iPad indirect distribution. The Retail segment accounted for 12% and 13% of the Company\\'s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nThe Company opened 33 new retail stores during 2012, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 390 stores open compared to 357 stores at the end of 2011. As of September 29, 2012, the Company had a total of 250 U.S. retail stores and 140 international retail stores. With an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3 million in 2011.\\nNet sales in the Retail segment increased $4.3 billion or 44% during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for iPad, higher Mac sales, and an increase in iPhone sales. The Company opened 40 new retail stores during 2011, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 357 stores open compared to 317 stores at the end of 2010. As of September 24, 2011, the Company had a total of 245 U.S. retail stores and 112 international retail stores. During 2011, the Company had an average of 326 stores compared to an average of 288 stores during 2010. The average revenue per store increased 27% to $43.3 million in 2011 compared to $34.1 million in 2010. The Retail segment represented 13% and 15% of the Company\\'s total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nThe Retail segment\\'s operating income was $4.6 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.2 billion during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. These year-over-year increases in Retail operating income were primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during the respective years.\\nGross Margin\\nGross margin for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):\\n \\nThe gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9%, compared to 40.5% in 2011. This year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iPhone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. The primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iPhone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. Additionally, gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs.\\nThe gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5%, compared to 39.4% in 2010. This year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs.\\nThe Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2012, and the Company anticipates gross margin of about 36% during the first quarter of 2013. Expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. Future strengthening of the U.S. dollar could further negatively impact gross margin.\\n \\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company\\'s expected gross margin percentage in future periods, including the first quarter of 2013, are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including, but not limited to those set forth above in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and those described in this paragraph. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\\'s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\\'s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses for 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages):\\n \\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\") Expense\\nR&D expense increased $952 million or 39% in 2012 compared to 2011 and $647 million or 36% in 2011 compared to 2010. The growth in R&D expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&D activities. Although total R&D expense increased 39% and 36% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales.\\nThe Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\\'s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive.\\nSelling, General and Administrative (\"SG&A\") Expense\\nSG&A expense increased $2.4 billion or 32% during 2012 compared to 2011 and $2.1 billion or 38% during 2011 compared to 2010. These increases were primarily due to the Company\\'s continued expansion of its Retail segment, increased headcount and related expenses, higher spending on professional services, marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the Company\\'s net sales.\\nOther Income and Expense\\nOther income and expense for 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows (in millions):\\n \\nTotal other income and expense increased $107 million or 26% to $522 million during 2012 compared to $415 million and $155 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2012 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income on the Company\\'s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. The overall increase in other income and expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to higher interest income and net realized gains on sales of marketable securities. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03%, 0.77%, and 0.75% during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense.\\n \\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe Company\\'s effective tax rates were approximately 25.2%, 24.2%, and 24.4% for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The Company\\'s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.\\nAs of September 29, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $4.0 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $14.9 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance.\\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") has completed its field audit of the Company\\'s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\\'s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\\'s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 29, 2012, September 24, 2011, and September 25, 2010 (in millions):\\n \\nAs of September 29, 2012, the Company had $121.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $39.7 billion or 49% from September 24, 2011. The principal components of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $50.9 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion, payments for acquisition of intangible assets of $1.1 billion and payments of dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $2.5 billion.\\nThe Company\\'s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. As of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, $82.6 billion and $54.3 billion, respectively, of the Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, common stock repurchases, dividends on its common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\\n \\nCapital Assets\\nThe Company\\'s capital expenditures were $10.3 billion during 2012, consisting of $865 million for retail store facilities and $9.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company\\'s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2012 were $8.3 billion.\\nThe Company anticipates utilizing approximately $10 billion for capital expenditures during 2013, including approximately $850 million for retail store facilities and approximately $9.15 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements.\\nDuring 2013, the Company expects to open about 30 to 35 new retail stores, with approximately three-quarters located outside of the U.S.\\nDividend and Stock Repurchase Program\\nIn March 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it plans to pay, subject to subsequent declaration, quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. The Company expects to pay approximately $2.5 billion each quarter in conjunction with the quarterly declared dividends.\\nIn March 2012, the Company\\'s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company\\'s common stock beginning in 2013. The repurchase program is expected to be executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. The Company anticipates that it will utilize approximately $45 billion of domestic cash to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and to remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units in the first three years of the dividend and stock repurchase programs. The Company anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the repurchase program will come primarily from current domestic cash and from on-going U.S. operating activities and the cash generated from such activities.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\\nThe Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company.\\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 29, 2012 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (in millions):\\n \\nLease Commitments\\nThe Company\\'s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 29, 2012, the Company\\'s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space.\\n \\nPurchase Commitments with Outsourcing Partners and Component Suppliers\\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\\'s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of September 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $21.1 billion.\\nOther Obligations\\nIn addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $988 million as of September 29, 2012, that were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.\\nThe Company\\'s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September 29, 2012, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $13.8 billion. Additionally, as of September 29, 2012, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.1 billion and an additional $401 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.\\nIndemnification\\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 29, 2012 or September 24, 2011.\\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.\\n \\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\\'s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\\'s leading industrialized countries, the Company\\'s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging.\\nThe Company\\'s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the Company. A portion of the Company\\'s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\\'s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company\\'s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance.\\nThe Company\\'s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\\'s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.\\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\\'s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 29, 2012, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $2.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 24, 2011, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would result in a $913 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\\'s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\\n \\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\\'s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\'s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $200 million as of September 29, 2012 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $161 million as of September 24, 2011. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\\'s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 29, 2012 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company\\'s actual exposures and positions.\\n \\nExhibit 99.2\\n \\n \\nAll financial statement schedules have been omitted, since the required information is not applicable or is not present in amounts sufficient to require submission of the schedule, or because the information required is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNote 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nApple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively \"Apple\" or the \"Company\") designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod compatible products including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers.\\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nCertain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year\\'s presentation. Prior period costs associated with the Company\\'s high-profile retail stores have been reclassified to conform to the current period\\'s presentation as described in Note 8, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data.\"\\nIn 2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in the Asia-Pacific segment; began allocating certain manufacturing costs and variances to its operating segments that were previously included in other corporate expenses; and changed its categorization of product-level net sales reporting. The Company has updated the 2012, 2011 and 2010 operating segment and product-level information to reflect the changes made in 2013.\\nIn 2013 the Company adopted amended accounting standards that change the presentation of comprehensive income. These standards increase the prominence of other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in shareholders\\' equity and requires the components of OCI to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements. The amended accounting standards only impact the financial statement presentation of OCI and do not change the components that are recognized in net income or OCI; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the Company\\'s financial position or results of operations.\\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on September 29, 2012, September 24, 2011, and September 25, 2010, respectively. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012. Fiscal years 2011 and 2010 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\\'s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\\'s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.\\n \\nFor the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company\\'s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nThe Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Company\\'s standard limited warranty.\\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company\\'s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\\'s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\\nRevenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\\'s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\\'s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\"VSOE\"), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (\"TPE\"), and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\"ESP\"). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.\\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch (\"iOS devices\"), Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. Essential software for iOS devices includes iOS and related applications and for Mac includes OS X, related applications and iLife. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product\\'s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.\\n \\nThe Company\\'s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The Company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products. This view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. The Company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. Therefore, the Company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the selling prices would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing of Apple-branded and third-party Mac and iOS compatible software, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified versus specified), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the impact of other products and services provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives, and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available. When relevant, the same factors are considered by the Company in developing ESPs for offerings such as the non-software services; however, the primary consideration in developing ESPs for the non-software services is the estimated cost to provide such services, including consideration for a reasonable profit margin.\\nFor the three years ended September 29, 2012, the Company\\'s combined ESPs for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the non-software services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $25. Revenue allocated to such rights included with iOS devices and Apple TV is recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, and revenue allocated to such rights included with Mac is recognized on a straight-line basis over four years.\\nShipping Costs\\nFor all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company\\'s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.\\nWarranty Expense\\nThe Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product\\'s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company\\'s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and generally software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2012, 2011 and 2010.\\n \\nAdvertising Costs\\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.0 billion, $933 million and $691 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nShare-based Compensation\\nThe Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise\\'s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company\\'s common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each option\\'s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (\"BSM\") option-pricing model. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders\\' Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 6, \"Shareholders\\' Equity and Share-based Compensation.\"\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, \"Income Taxes\" for additional information.\\nEarnings Per Share\\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Company\\'s employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company\\'s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.\\n \\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):\\n \\nPotentially dilutive securities representing 1.0 million, 1.7 million and 1.6 million shares of common stock for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.\\nFinancial Instruments\\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company\\'s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument\\'s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. The Company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company\\'s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders\\' equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.\\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") in shareholders\\' equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company had no fair value hedges in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through current income.\\n \\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nThe Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company\\'s customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers\\' ability to pay.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company\\'s inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $2.6 billion, $1.6 billion and $815 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\\nThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any significant impairments during 2012, 2011 and 2010.\\nThe Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2012 and 2011, the Company\\'s goodwill was allocated to the Americas and Europe reportable operating segments.\\nThe Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods typically from three to seven years.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nThe Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\\n Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 1\\n \\n Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 2\\n Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\'s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\\nLevel 3\\nThe Company\\'s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\\nIn accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.\\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\\nThe Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders\\' equity. The Company\\'s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant and have been included in the Company\\'s results of operations.\\n \\nNote 2  Financial Instruments\\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nThe following tables show the Company\\'s cash and available-for-sale securities\\' adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment category recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short- or long-term marketable securities as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\n \\n \\nThe net unrealized gains as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 are related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The net realized gains or losses recognized during 2012 and 2011 were $183 million and $110 million, respectively, and no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010 related to such sales. The maturities of the Company\\'s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years.\\nAs of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.\\nAs of September 29, 2012, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company\\'s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment\\'s cost basis. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nThe Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities.\\nTo help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\\'s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company\\'s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\\' functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases generally up to six months.\\n \\nTo help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nThe Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nThe Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company\\'s accounting treatment of these instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.\\nThe Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $240 million and a net deferred gain of approximately $290 million, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. The majority of the Company\\'s hedged transactions as of September 29, 2012 are expected to occur within six months.\\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2012, 2011 and 2010.\\nThe Company\\'s unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of AOCI, were not significant as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. The ineffective portions of and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense.\\nThe gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.\\n \\nThe following table shows the notional principal amounts of the Company\\'s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\n \\nThe notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company\\'s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company\\'s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company\\'s gross exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Company\\'s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company\\'s foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.\\nThe Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of September 29, 2012, the Company posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $278 million, which it recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 24, 2011, the Company received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $288 million, which it recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of September 29, 2012 or September 24, 2011.\\n \\nThe following tables show the Company\\'s derivative instruments at gross fair value as reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe following table shows the pre-tax effect of the Company\\'s derivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAccounts Receivable\\nTrade Receivables\\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\\nAs of September 29, 2012, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other 10%. As of September 24, 2011, there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company\\'s total trade receivables. The Company\\'s cellular network carriers accounted for 66% and 52% of trade receivables as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. The additions and write-offs to the Company\\'s allowance for doubtful accounts during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were not significant.\\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Company\\'s vendors accounted for 45%, 21% and 12% of total non-trade receivables as of September 29, 2012 and vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Company\\'s vendors accounted for 53% and 29% of total non-trade receivables as of September 24, 2011. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.\\nNote 3  Consolidated Financial Statement Details\\nThe following tables show the Company\\'s consolidated financial statement details as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\n \\n \\nAccrued Expenses\\n \\nNon-Current Liabilities\\n \\nNote 4  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nThe Company\\'s acquired intangible assets with definite lives primarily consist of patents and licenses and are amortized over periods typically from three to seven years. The following table summarizes the components of gross and net intangible asset balances as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\n \\nDuring 2012 and 2011, the Company completed various business acquisitions. In 2012, the aggregate cash consideration, net of cash acquired, was $350 million, of which $245 million was allocated to goodwill, $113 million to acquired intangible assets and $8 million to liabilities assumed. In 2011, the aggregate cash consideration, net of cash acquired, was $244 million, of which $167 million was allocated to goodwill and $77 million to acquired intangible assets.\\nThe Company\\'s gross carrying amount of goodwill was $1.1 billion and $896 million as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. The Company did not have any goodwill impairment during 2012, 2011 or 2010.\\n \\nAmortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $605 million, $192 million and $69 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of September 29, 2012 the remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired intangible assets is 5.2 years. The expected annual amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets as of September 29, 2012, is as follows (in millions):\\n \\nNote 5  Income Taxes\\nThe provision for income taxes for 2012, 2011, and 2010, consisted of the following (in millions):\\n \\nThe foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $36.8 billion, $24.0 billion and $13.0 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company\\'s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company\\'s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. As of September 29, 2012, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $40.4 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $13.8 billion.\\nAs of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, $82.6 billion and $54.3 billion, respectively, of the Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S.\\n \\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2012, 2011 and 2010) to income before provision for income taxes for 2012, 2011, and 2010, is as follows (in millions):\\n \\nThe Company\\'s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the tax effect of the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the exercise price. For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award\\'s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock\\'s fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $742 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.\\nAs of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, the significant components of the Company\\'s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):\\n \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nTax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n \\nAs of September 29, 2012, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889 million, if recognized, would affect the Company\\'s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2011, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $1.4 billion, of which $563 million, if recognized, would affect the Company\\'s effective tax rate.\\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2012, 2011, and 2010, is as follows (in millions):\\n \\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $401 million and $261 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest expense in 2012 and 2011 of $140 million and $14 million, respectively, and in 2010 the Company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million.\\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are closed. The Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") has completed its field audit of the Company\\'s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1989 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.\\nManagement believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\\'s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\\'s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $120 million and $170 million in the next 12 months.\\nNote 6  Shareholders\\' Equity and Share-based Compensation\\nPreferred Stock\\nThe Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company\\'s Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company\\'s authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.\\nDividend and Stock Repurchase Program\\nIn 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it plans to make, subject to subsequent declaration, quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. On July 24, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $2.65 per share to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 13, 2012. The Company paid $2.5 billion in conjunction with this dividend on August 16, 2012. No dividends were declared in the first three quarters of 2012 or in 2011 and 2010\\n.\\n \\nIn 2012, the Company\\'s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company\\'s common stock beginning in 2013. The repurchase program is expected to be executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. In August 2012, the Company entered into a Rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") program with a financial institution to purchase up to $2 billion of the Company\\'s common stock during 2013. The total number of shares to be purchased under the ASR program will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company\\'s common stock during the purchase period and will be reflected as a reduction of shares outstanding on the date of purchase. The Company may also purchase its common stock in open market transactions, in compliance with all applicable securities laws.\\nComprehensive Income\\nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders\\' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company\\'s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\nThe following table shows the components of AOCI, net of taxes, as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\n \\nThe change in fair value of available-for-sale securities included in other comprehensive income was $601 million, $(41) million and $123 million, net of taxes in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tax effect related to the change in unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities was $(353) million, $24 million and $(72) million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nThe following table shows activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives, net of taxes, held by the Company during 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions):\\n \\nThe tax effect related to the changes in fair value of derivatives was $73 million, $(50) million and $97 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tax effect related to derivative gains/losses reclassified from other comprehensive income to income was $220 million, $(250) million and $43 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\n \\nEmployee Benefit Plans\\n2003 Employee Stock Plan\\nThe 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the \"2003 Plan\") is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\\'s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to an award granted under the 2003 Plan (other than a stock option or stock appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in respect of an option or stock appreciation right count against the number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (\"DER\"), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DER are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DER are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 29, 2012, approximately 37.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan.\\n1997 Director Stock Plan\\nThe 1997 Director Stock Plan (the \"Director Plan\") is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company\\'s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company\\'s common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DER. As of September 29, 2012, approximately 184,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.\\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2012, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Phillip W. Schiller and Jeffrey E. Williams, and directors William V. Campbell and Arthur D. Levinson had equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or a formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company\\'s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company\\'s employee and director equity plans.\\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"Purchase Plan\") is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company\\'s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee\\'s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee\\'s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 29, 2012, approximately 2.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.\\n401(k) Plan\\nThe Company\\'s 401(k) Plan (the \"401(k) Plan\") is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($17,000 for calendar year 2012). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee\\'s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee\\'s eligible earnings. The Company\\'s matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $114 million, $90 million and $72 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\n \\nRestricted Stock Units\\nA summary of the Company\\'s RSU activity and related information for 2012, 2011, and 2010, is as follows:\\n \\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $3.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees\\' minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 2.3 million, 1.6 million and 1.8 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company\\'s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees\\' tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.2 billion, $520 million and $406 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.\\nStock Option Activity\\nA summary of the Company\\'s stock option activity and related information for 2012, 2011, and 2010, is as follows:\\n \\n \\nAggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company\\'s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nShare-based Compensation\\nShare-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company\\'s common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (\"stock purchase rights\") is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest rates. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\\nThe Company did not grant any stock options during 2012. The Company granted 1,370 and 34,000 stock options during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during 2011 and 2010 was $181.13 and $108.58, respectively.\\nDuring 2012 and 2010, in conjunction with certain business combinations, the Company assumed 41,000 and 98,000 stock options, respectively, which had a weighted-average fair value per share of $405.39 and $216.82, respectively. The Company did not assume any stock options during 2011.\\nThe weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $108.44, $71.47 and $45.03 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nThe following table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions):\\n \\nThe income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $567 million, $467 million and $314 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of September 29, 2012, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and RSUs was $4.2 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.3 years.\\nNote 7  Commitments and Contingencies\\nAccrued Warranty and Indemnification\\nThe Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company\\'s hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\\'s typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.\\n \\nThe following table shows changes in the Company\\'s accrued warranties and related costs for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions):\\n \\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either September 29, 2012 or September 24, 2011.\\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\\nThe Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company\\'s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\\'s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company\\'s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company\\'s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company\\'s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company\\'s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.\\n \\nLong-Term Supply Agreements\\nThe Company has entered into long-term agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. Under certain of these agreements, which expire between 2012 and 2022, the Company has made prepayments for the future purchase of inventory components and has acquired capital equipment to use in the manufacturing of such components.\\nAs of September 29, 2012, the Company had a total of $4.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $1.2 billion are classified as other current assets and $3.0 billion are classified as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had a total of $2.3 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of September 24, 2011. The Company\\'s outstanding prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made during the term of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $943 million and $173 million of inventory component prepayments during 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\\nLease Commitments\\nThe Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 29, 2012, the Company\\'s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space.\\nRent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $488 million, $338 million and $271 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2012, are as follows (in millions):\\n \\nOther Commitments\\nAs of September 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $21.1 billion.\\nIn addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $988 million as of September 29, 2012, which were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.\\nContingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of the Form 10-K under the heading \"Legal Proceedings\" and in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\\'s expectations, the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\n \\nApple Inc. vs Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.\\nOn August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. Because the award is subject to entry of final judgment and may be subject to appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 29, 2012.\\nNote 8\\nSegment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company reports segment information based on the \"management\" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company\\'s reportable segments.\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. In 2013, the Company established a new reportable operating segment, Greater China, which was previously included in the Asia-Pacific segment. Reportable operating segment data for 2012, 2011 and 2010 have been reclassified to reflect establishment of the Greater China segment. The Company\\'s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan and those countries included in the Greater China segment. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. The results of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Company\\'s retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\\nBeginning in 2013, the Company began allocating certain manufacturing costs and variances, including costs related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, to its operating segments that were previously included in other corporate expenses. As a result, the Company reclassified $763 million, $1.3 billion and $621 million from other corporate expenses to its operating segments for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nPrior to 2012, the Company allocated to corporate expenses certain costs associated with its high-profile retail stores that have been designed and built to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Beginning in 2012, the Company no longer allocates these costs to corporate expenses and reclassified $102 million and $75 million of such costs from corporate to Retail segment expenses for 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nSegment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the Retail segment also includes capital assets. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $858 million, $612 million and $392 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company\\'s total depreciation and amortization was $3.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $319 million, $273 million and $198 million was related to the Retail segment in the respective years. Depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant.\\n \\nThe following table shows information by operating segment for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions):\\n \\nA reconciliation of the Company\\'s segment operating income to the consolidated financial statements for 2012, 2011, and 2010, is as follows (in millions):\\n \\nThe following table shows total assets by segment and a reconciliation to the consolidated financial statements as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):\\n \\n \\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company\\'s net sales in 2012 and 2011. No single country other than the U.S. accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2010. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2012, 2011 or 2010. Net sales for 2012, 2011, and 2010 and long-lived assets as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 are as follows (in millions):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn 2013, the Company realigned its reporting of product-level net sales. Reported net sales of the Company\\'s hardware categories no longer include related service and accessory revenue. The Company also began reporting separate categories for iTunes, software and services, and for accessories. Net sales by product for 2012, 2011 and 2010 has been reclassified to conform to the Company\\'s 2013 presentation and is as follows (in millions):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNote 9  Selected Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\\nThe following tables show a summary of the Company\\'s quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters of 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except per share amounts):\\n \\n \\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented.

The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:\\n(a)      The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction;\\n(b)      Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to you such written opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and such other related matters as you may\\n \\nreasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;\\n(c)      Hogan Lovells US LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to you its written opinion and negative assurance letter, each dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, substantially in the forms attached hereto as Annex II(a)(i) and Annex II(a)(ii), respectively.\\n(d)      Gene D.

(a)      The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any \"issuer information\" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,\\n \\ndamage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in (I) the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. expressly for use therein or (II) that portion of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification on Form T-1 of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act.\\n(b)      Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.\\n(c)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense\\n \\nthereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.\\n(d)      If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties\\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.\\n \\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters\\' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.\\n(e)      The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.\\n10.     (a)      If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term \"\" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.\\nUnderwriter\\n(b)      If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such\\n \\nUnderwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.\\n(c)      If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.\\n11.      The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.\\n12.      If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.\\n13.      In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by Goldman, Sachs & Co. or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. on behalf of you as the representatives.\\nAll statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282-2198, Attention: Registration Department; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 60 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005, Attention: Debt Capital Markets Syndicate; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration\\n \\nStatement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters\\' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.\\nIn accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.\\n14.      This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.

If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR\\nwill be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the calculation agent (after consultation with the Issuer) will select three major reference banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.

Each calculation of the interest rate on this Note by the calculation agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Holders of this Note and the Issuer.\\nUpon written request from any Holder, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect on the Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.\\nThe interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.\\n \\nInitially, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Notes are subject to all such terms, and holders of Notes are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of them.\\nTo the extent the terms of the Indenture and this Note are inconsistent, the terms of the Indenture shall govern.\\nThe Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture and the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a Note.\\n \\nIf an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer) under the Indenture occurs with respect to the Notes and is continuing, then the Trustee may and, at the direction of the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, shall by written notice, require the Issuer to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any. If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it has received indemnity as it reasonably requires. The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Notes notice of certain continuing defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is not opposed to their interest.\\n \\nThis Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Note.\\n \\nCustomary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Note or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).\\n \\nPursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes as a convenience to the Holders of the Notes.
